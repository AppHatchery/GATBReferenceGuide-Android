    <p><i> <b>In Short:</b> We collect personal information that you provide to us.</i></p>

    <p> We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining
        information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the App or otherwise
        when you contact us.</p>
    <p>
        The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the App, the
        choices you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the
        following:</p>

    <p> All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate, and you must notify us of
        any changes to such personal information.</p>

    <h4>Information automatically collected</h4>

    <b> In Short:</b> <i>Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device
    characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our App.</i>

    <p> We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the App. This information does not
        reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage
        information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
        preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our App and
        other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our
        App, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

    <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
        <li><i>Log and Usage Data.</i> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage and performance
            information our

            how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and
            settings and information about your activity in the App (such as the date/time stamps associated with your
            usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which features you use), device
            event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called 'crash dumps') and hardware
            settings).
        </li>

        <li>
            <i>Device Data</i>. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet or other

        </li>

        <li><i>Location Data.</i> We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can
            be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the
            device you use to access the App. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation
            data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to
            collect
            this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your
            device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h4> Information collected through our App</h4>

        App.</i></p>

    <p> If you use our App, we also collect the following information:</p>

    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
        <li>Mobile Device Access. We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device,
            including your mobile device's calendar, microphone, and other features. If you wish to change our access or
            permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.

            manufacturer), operating system, version information and system configuration information, device and
            application identification numbers, browser type and version, hardware model Internet service provider
            and/or mobile carrier, and Internet Protocol (IP) address (or proxy server). If you are using our App, we
            may also collect information about the phone network associated with your mobile device, your mobile
            device’s operating system or platform, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device
            ID and information about the features of our App you accessed.
        </li>
        <li>Push Notifications. We may request to send you push notifications regarding your account or certain features
            of the App. If you wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in

    </ul>


    <h3>3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</h3>

    <p><i><b>In Short: </b> We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with

        your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</i></p>

    <p> We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:</p>

    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">

        </li>
        <li>Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate

        <li>Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal
            information to fulfill the terms of our contract.
        </li>
        <li>Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to
            proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in
            response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
        </li>
        <li>Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent,
            or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving
            potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which
            we are involved.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following

        </li>
        <li>Affiliates. We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those

            services or promotions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> 4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

    <p><i><b> In Short: </b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
        privacy notice
        unless otherwise required by law.</i></p>


    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy
    notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
    requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years.

    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
    anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
    stored
    in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
    processing
    until deletion is possible.

    <h3> 5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>

    In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security
    measures.

    <p> We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security
        of
        any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
        electronic
        transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
        cannot
        promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
        defeat
        our
        security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
        protect
        your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You
        should
        only
        access the App within a secure environment.</p>

    <h3> 6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>

    <p><i><b>In Short: </b> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</i></p>


    <p> We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the App, you
        represent
        that
        you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s
        use
        of
        the App. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will
        deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become
        aware
        of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
        morgan.greenleaf@emory.edu.</p>

    <h3>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
    <p><i><b> In Short: </b> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</i></p>

    <p> If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information,
        you
        also
        have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact
        details
        here:
        https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.</p>

    <p> If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available
        here:
        https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.
    </p>
    <h3>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>

    <p> Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
        feature
        or
        setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
        activities
        monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
        signals
        has
        been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
        automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
        follow
        in
        the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
    </p>
    <h3> 9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>

    <p><i><b>In Short: </b> Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access
        to your
        personal
        information.</i></p>

        personal
        information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of
        all
        third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a
        California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the
        contact
        information provided below.</p>

    <p> If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the App, you have the
        right
        to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the App. To request removal of such data, please
        contact
        us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and
        a

        please
        be
        aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).
    </p>
    <h3> 10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h3>

    <p><i><b> In Short: </b> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</i></p>

    <p> We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
        "Revised"

        and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this
        privacy
        notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a
        notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting
        your
        information.
    </p>
