    <p>In some persons (especially individuals > 50 years of age) with
        LTBI, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to tuberculin may
        wane over time. When a TST is performed years after infection
        has occurred, these persons may have an initial negative tuberculin skin test result. However, this initial
        test may stimulate
        (boost) their ability to react to subsequent tuberculin testing,
        causing a positive reaction to subsequent tuberculin skin tests.
        The boosted reaction represents a true positive result but not a
        true conversion due to recent infection. Two-step tuberculin skin
        testing is used to distinguish between boosted reactions and
        reactions due to new infection.</p>
    <p>Two-step testing (at baseline) is recommended for employees or
        residents in institutional settings (such as health care workers or
        correctional facility employees) who may undergo periodic tuberculin screening (and have not had a TST in
        the past year), and
        for whom it is important to distinguish between new infection
        and a boosted reaction from past infection.</p>

    <h4> Two-Step Testing</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the first test with 0.1 ml (5 TU) of tuberculin.</li>
        <li>If the reaction to the first test is negative, give a
            second test with the same dose and strength of
            tuberculin, 1-3 weeks later. (If the reaction to the first
            test is positive, consider the person infected, and
            there is no need for a second test.)
        </li>
        <li>If the second test is positive, consider the person
            infected.
        </li>
        <li>If the second test is negative, consider the person
            uninfected.
        </li>
        <li>Individuals who have a positive reaction to either test
            require a follow-up evaluation with chest x-ray.
        </li>
        <li>For individuals who will undergo serial tes!ng (e.g.,
            annual tuberculin tes!ng), two-step tes!ng is
            required for only the first test to establish a baseline
            negative test. Subsequent tuberculin tes!ng should
            include only one test.
        </li>
    </ol>
