        <p><b>Safe: </b>Drug has not been demonstrated to have teratogenic effects.</p>
        <p><b>Avoid: </b>Limited data on safety or for aminoglycosides associated with hearing impairment and/or
            other toxicity.</p>
        <p><b>Do Not Use: </b>Associated with premature labor, congenital malformations or teratogenicity.</p>
        <p><b>NOTES: Table 20 Special Situations</b></p>

        <p>(1) As
            with all medications given during pregnancy, anti-TB drugs should be used with caution. The risk of TB to
            the
            fetus far outweighs the risk of medications. Pregnant patients with active TB should be treated. Data are
            limited on the safety of some anti-TB drugs during pregnancy. Table 20 presents a consensus of published
            data
            and recommendations. Although detailed teratogenic data is not available, PZA can probably be used safely
            for
            pregnant patients. Concentrations of anti-TB drugs in breast milk are low; treatment with these medications
            is
            not a contraindication to breastfeeding. (Conversely, medication present in breast milk is not sufficient to
            prevent or treat TB in the newborn.) Consult a medical expert when treating a pregnant patient who has TB.
            For
            treatment of LTBI, most authorities recommend beginning INH several months after delivery, unless the woman
            is
            at high risk for progression to active TB (e.g., recent TST or IGRA conversion, HIV-infected).</p>
        <p>(2) Steroid treatment appears to improve outcome in TB meningitis, particularly in patients with altered
            mental
            status.</p>
        <p>(3) If possible, monitor serum drug levels of patients with renal insufficiency. See page 71 for dosage.</p>
        <p>(4) Supplement with pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) during pregnancy.</p>
        <p>(5) Has been used intrathecally; efficacy not documented.</p>
        <p>(6) Avoid aminoglycosides and capreomycin in patients with reversible renal damage, if possible.</p>
        <p>(7) Fluoroquinolones may accumulate in renal failure and are poorly removed by dialysis. Dose adjustment
            indicated.
