        Treatment regimens for LTBI are outlined in <a
            href="#table4">Table 4</a>. Several
        different LTBI treatment regimens are recommended by CDC.
    </p>
    <h5>These include:</h5>

    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
        <li><b>Rifampin.</b>Rifampin for 4 months is a preferred CDC treatment regimen for the treatment of LTBI among
            persons
            presumed to be infected with drug-susceptible TB (INH and
            rifampin susceptible) and is the regimen of choice for the
            treatment of LTBI among persons thought to be infected
            with INH-resistant strains. Rifampin is also preferred by
            many clinicians and public health clinics because of the
            shorter duration of therapy compared to INH. Rifampin has
            less hepatotoxicity compared to INH for the treatment of
            LTBI. Rifampin for 4 months has been shown to be noninferior to 9 months of INH for the treatment of LTBI in
            a
            randomized controlled trial. In addition, rifampin was associated with higher completion rates and fewer
            adverse effects compared to INH. Rifampin has a large number of drug
            -drug interactions (as discussed on page 78 ) including warfarin, oral contraceptives, azole antifungals,
            and HIV antiretroviral therapy. Other medications that a person with
            LTBI is taking is an important consideration when determining whether rifampin or other LTBI regimens which
            include
            rifampin or other rifamycins can be prescribed. Drug-drug
            interactions between rifamycins and antiretroviral therapy
            are regularly updated by the U.S. Department of Health and
            Human Services <a
                    href="https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/4/ adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infection/0">(https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/4/adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infection/0)</a>.
        </li>

        <li><b>INH plus Rifapentine (3HP).</b> A short course regimen of
            weekly INH plus rifapentine for 12 weekly doses is another
            CDC-preferred regimen for the treatment of LTBI (due to presumed infection with drug-susceptible M.
            tuberculosis) in
            adults as well as children > 2 years of age. In 2011, CDC first
            recommended 3HP for the treatment of LTBI and that it be
            by directly observed therapy [DOT]. However, based on
            recent studies and updated data, CDC revised guidelines for
            the use of 3HP in 2018 and expanded the patient populations
            for which this regimen could be used and included an option
            for self-administration of the 3HP regimen. CDC recommendations for 3HP in the treatment of LTBI include:
            <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
                <li>use of 3HP in adults and persons aged 2–17 years with
                    LTBI;
                </li>
                <li>use of 3HP in persons who are living with HIV with
                    LTBI including those with AIDS and taking antiretroviral medications with acceptable drug-drug
                    interactions with rifapentine*; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    use of 3HP by directly observed therapy (DOT) or self
                    -administered therapy (SAT) in persons aged ≥ 2
                    years. Per CDC recommendations, “the health care
                    provider should choose the mode of administration
                    (DOT versus SAT) based on local practice, individual
                    patient attributes and preferences, and other considerations, including risk for progression to
                    severe
                    forms of TB disease” (MMWR 2018; 67:723-72).

                </li>
            </ul>
            The 3HP is regimen is NOT recommended for pregnant
            women, children < 2 years old, persons living with HIV who
            are on antiretroviral drugs that have significant drug-drug interactions with rifapentine, or patients
            infected with suspected INH-resistant, rifampin-resistant, or MDR isolates.
            Other potential disadvantages of the 3HP regimen in addition to the drug-drug interactions due to
            rifapentine (similar
            to those seen with other rifamycin drugs such as rifampin)
            include cost of medications that are greater than most alternatives; the need to take numerous pills
            simultaneously (10
            pills once weekly compared with two or three pills daily for
            other regimens for most adults); and the association with a
            systemic drug reaction or influenza-like syndrome that can
            include syncope and hypotension (although the risk of hospitalization is low, 0.1% in published studies).
        </li>

        <li><b>Isoniazid (INH).</b> In the new CDC 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines, 6 or 9 months of daily INH is a
            recommended alternative regimen for the treatment of LTBI (due to presumed
            infection with drug susceptible M. tuberculosis) as shown in
            <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>. A regimen of 6 months of daily INH is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of
            all ages
            and conditionally recommended for HIV-positive adults and
            children of all ages; INH daily for 9 months is conditionally
            recommended for adults and children of all ages, both HIVnegative and HIV-positive. One practical approach
            for the
            use of INH for LTBI is to aim for a 9 month regimen with the
            goal of completion of at least 6 months. INH can be given
            daily (e.g., by self-administered therapy) or twice weekly (if
            given by directly observed therapy) as outlined in <a href="#table5">Table 5</a>.
            INH should be used for the treatment of LTBI when there
            are serious potential drug-drug interactions with rifampin
            or other rifamycins.
        </li>

        <li><b>Isoniazid (INH) plus Rifampin.</b> A regimen of 3 months of
            daily INH plus daily rifampin is a CDC conditionally recommended regimen for the treatment of LTBI in adults
            and
            children of all ages. Because this regimen contains rifampin,
            clinicians must closely review other medications that a person with LTBI is on to assess whether there are
            drug-drug
            interactions that would prohibit the use of this regimen (as
            discussed above for rifampin).

        <i>* Hypersensitivity reaction to rifamycins (rifampin or rifapentine): reactions may
            include a flu-like syndrome (e.g. fever, chills, headaches, dizziness, musculoskeletal pain),
            thrombocytopenia, shortness of breath or other signs and symptoms including wheezing, acute bronchospasm,
            urticaria, petechiae, purpura,
            pruritus, conjunctivitis, angioedema, hypotension or shock. If moderate to
            severe reaction (e.g. thrombocytopenia, hypotension), hospitalization or lifethreatening event: Discontinue
            treatment. If mild reaction (e.g. rash, dizziness,
            fever): Continue to monitor patient closely with a low threshold for discontinuing treatment. A flu-like
            syndrome appears to be the most common side effect
            profile leading to discontinuation of the 3HP regimen.</i>
