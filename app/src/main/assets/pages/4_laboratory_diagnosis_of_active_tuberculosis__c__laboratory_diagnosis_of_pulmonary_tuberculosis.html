        <li>Immunocompromised patients are less likely to have typical
            CXR findings.<b> A normal CXR does not rule out active pulmonary TB.</b></li>

        <li>A minimum of two AFB smears is generally recommended
            for persons with suspected pulmonary TB. The overall sensitivity of AFB smear for pulmonary TB is 50% to
            70%, and the sensitivity is reduced among immunosuppressed and pediatric patients.
        </li>
        <li>First morning sputum specimens have increased sensitivity
            and at least one first morning specimen should be obtained.
        </li>
        <li>The sensitivity of ATS/IDSA/CDC endorsed NAATs for
            smear-negative and smear-positive TB are approximately
            67% and 96% respectively. <b>A negative NAAT performed on a
                smear-negative sample does not rule out TB,</b> whereas a
            negative NAAT performed on a smear-positive sample usually indicates presence of non-tuberculous
            mycobacteria.
        </li>
        <li>For patients with suspected pulmonary TB who are unable
            to produce good quality sputum (defined as > 3 ml of sputum), consider obtaining <i>induced</i> sputum
            sample (using 3%
            NaCl aerosol) for smear, culture, and NAAT samples.
        </li>
        <li>Consider obtaining bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy for smear, culture, NAAT, and histopathology: a)
            for patients with suspected pulmonary TB when sputum induction
            fails to produce good quality samples; b) when empiric TB
            treatment is unacceptable (e.g., high-risk for MDR TB); and/
            or c) when bronchoscopy is indicated to investigate alternative diagnosis (e.g., lung cancer).
        </li>
        <li><b>Bronchoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure, and
            infection control measures for airborne pathogens should
            be observed.</b></li>
        <li>Consider obtaining post-bronchoscopy sputum sample for
            smear and culture.
        </li>
        <li>Children are more likely to have paucibacilliary disease and
            are often unable to produce good quality sputum specimens.
            However, clinicians should pursue microbiological TB diagnosis when feasible. Gastric aspirate when
            appropriately
            performed has yield > 50%. Instruct patients to fast overnight. Commensal non-tuberculous mycobacteria are
            present in the GI tract and a positive AFB smear should be interpreted with caution.
