    <p>The temporary exacerbation of TB symptoms and lesions after initiation of antituberculosis therapy—known as a
        paradoxical reaction or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) —has been described as a rare
        occurrence
        in HIV-negative patients after the initiation of antituberculosis therapy. These “paradoxical reactions” are
        thought
        to be due to immune reconstitution and can occur among persons living with HIV who are started on antiretroviral
        therapy early in the course of antituberculosis therapy. After initial clinical improvement, paradoxical
        worsening
        of disease (or IRIS) developed in up to 36% of HIV infected TB patients on ART compared with 7% of HIV
        coinfected
        patients treated for TB but who did not receive ART [Narita et al.].</p>

    <p>Paradoxical or immune reconstitution manifestations depend on anatomical site of disease (e.g., headache in
        patient
        with menin- geal TB). Additionally, IRIS can occur in an anatomical site of known disease and/or anatomical
        sites
        not previously known to be involved (e.g., lymph node suppuration in patient without previous adenopathy), a
        process
        known as “unmasking”. Of note, patients with HIV can have > 1 opportunistic infection and unmasking reactions
        can
        occur that are from previously unsuspected infections (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis). The paradoxical reactions
        are
        associated with increased reactivity on tuberculin skin testing and a significant reduction in HIV viral
        load.</p>

    <p>IRIS may be self-limited and can last 10 to 40 days. Mild to moderate reactions can be managed by reassurance and
        nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Severe reactions included those characterized by marked increase in
        adenopathy
        causing an anatomic problem (e.g., compromised breathing, swallowing or movement of the neck, or expanding
        central
        nervous system lesions) can be managed with corticosteroids (with continuation of the anti-tuberculosis therapy
        and
        ART) starting at a dose of prednisone at 1.25—1.5 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks and then tapering the therapy over a
        period of 6 to 12 weeks (or longer).</p>

    <p>For persons living with HIV with active TB disease and at high risk for developing TB-associated immune
        reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS), pre-emptive prednisone is now rec- ommended as adjunctive
        therapy
        with the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. “High-risk” for IRIS is defined as CD4 count ≤ 100 cells/mm3 and
        starting ART within 30 days of initiating treatment for active TB. The prednisone regimen consists of 40 mg
        daily
        for 2 weeks followed by 20 mg daily for 2 weeks. Preemptive prednisone therapy for IRIS prevention should NOT be
        offered to patients with active hepatitis B infection, Kaposi sarcoma, rifampin-resistant TB, or with poor
        response
        to TB treatment.</p>
