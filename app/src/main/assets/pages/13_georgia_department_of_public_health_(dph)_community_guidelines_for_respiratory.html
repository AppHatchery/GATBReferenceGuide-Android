    <p>In
        setting guidelines, the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) follows
        CDC recommendations that a stepwise approach be used to seek the least intrusive policy that is consistent with
        maintaining the health of the community. These guidelines provide a framework for clinical management of
        patients with TB. The management of each patient must be customized to the individualâ€™s circumstances, living
        environment, and compliance with TB therapy. The guidelines classify active TB cases into three grades of
        <u>infectiousness</u> and two grades of <u>organism</u> <u>resistance</u>. They recommend appropriate levels of
        <u>housing</u> <u>options</u> and degrees of <u>respiratory</u> <u>isolation</u> for each grade of
        infectiousness and resistance.</p>
    <p><u>Infectiousness</u> is graded by AFB smear, TB culture results, clinical improvement in response to
        medical therapy, and evidence of adherence with therapy.</p>
    <h4>Grades of
        Infectiousness:</h4>
    <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0;text-align: left;">Grade I: smear
        positive, culture positive</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Grade II: smear
        negative, culture positive or unknown</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Grade III: smear negative,
        culture negative</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 65pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><i>Smear negative =
        three consecutive negative sputum AFB smears on separate days.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 65pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><i>Culture negative =
        three consecutive negative AFB cultures one week apart.</i></p>
    <p>Drug susceptibility or drug resistance is based on the drug susceptibility testing results of the <i>M.
        tuberculosis </i>isolate recovered from the patient. TB isolates are considered fully susceptible if they
        have been shown to be susceptible to all first line anti-TB drugs. Resistant strains are those resistant to one
        or more anti-TB drugs.</p>
    <p>
        <u>Housing options</u> include the home for patients who can return to a
        stable home and three levels of facilities for those without a stable home.</p>
    <h4>Levels of housing:</h4>
    <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0;text-align: left;">Level 1: Acute care hospital, Alternative Housing
        Program (smear positive, medi- cally stable and clinical improving)</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0;text-align: left;">Level 2:
        Shelters that require negative smears; trained staff provide DOT, Alternative Housing Program (smear positive,
        medically stable and clinical improving)</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0;text-align: left;">Level 3:
        Shelters that require negative cultures; trained staff for DOT available</p>
    <p>These categories of
        <u>respiratory</u> <u>isolation</u>, based on guidelines from the National Jewish Center for Immunology and
        Respiratory Disease, regulate patient activities and use of masks based on grade of infectiousness:</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0;text-align: left;">a. Activity defined by
        the Level 1 institution;</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0;text-align: left;">b.
        Home permitted provided that no new persons will be <span style=" color: #231F20;">exposed in the home;</span>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0;text-align: left;">c. Wear mask to medical
        appointments, otherwise stay home;</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0;text-align: left;">d. Wear mask only when indoors
        around unexposed persons.</p>
    <p>Per CDC
        guidelines, use simple surgical masks for patients. Isolation categories apply to patients with clinical
        improvement in response to medical therapy (e.g., resolution of fever, diminished cough, reduced number of
        organisms on AFB smear) and evidence of adherence with therapy. DOT is the standard of care for all TB
        patients in Georgia.</p>
    <h4>TB Infection Control in the
        Home</h4>
    <p>Patients
        with TB disease can be sent home even if they do not have two negative sputum smears, if the following criteria
        are met:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A
            follow-up plan has been made with the local TB program;
        </li>
        <li>The patient is on standard TB treatment, and directly observed therapy (DOT) has been
            arranged;
        </li>
        <li>No infants or children less than 5 years of age or persons with immunocompromising conditions are
            present in the household; and
        </li>
        <li>The patient is willing to remain isolated in the home except for healthcare associated visits
            until the patient has negative sputum smear results. Patients who have suspected or confirmed TB disease
            are more likely to have already transmitted TB infection to members of their household before their TB
            disease was diagnosed and treatment was started.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, TB
        patients and members of their household should take steps to prevent the further spread of TB infection after
        they return home. Patients with TB disease should</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be instructed to cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing;</li>
        <li>Sleep alone and not in a room with other household members; and</li>
        <li>Refrain from having visitors in the home until they are noninfectious.</li>
    </ul>
