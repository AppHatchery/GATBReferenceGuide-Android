    <p>TB is a
        reportable disease in Georgia. All Georgia physicians, laboratories, and other health care providers are
        required by law to immediately report clinical and laboratory—confirmed TB (including extrapulmonary) cases
        under their care to Georgia public health authorities. TB cases may be directly reported to a County Health
        Department, a District Health Office, or to the State TB Program and TB Epidemiology Section of the Georgia
        Department of Public Health (GDPH), which is responsible for the systematic collection of all reported TB cases
        in the state. Immediate reporting of TB cases enables public health staff to follow up with patients,
        administer directly observed therapy (DOT), monitor TB treatment until completion, evaluate and screen
        individuals exposed to a TB case, and control TB outbreaks.</p>
    <p>
        Cases may be reported electronically through <b>SendSS </b>at <a href="http://sendss.state.ga.us">http://sendss.state.ga.us </a>,
        by calling 1-866-782-4584, or by calling the public health department in the
        county where the patient resides (see Appendix). Hospital infection control
        personnel, as well as public health nurses, outreach staff, epidemiologists, and communicable disease
        specialists involved in disease surveillance are encouraged to report TB through SendSS and register to
        become a SendSS user by logging into the system’s Web site at: <a href="http://sendss.state.ga.us">http://sendss.state.ga.us</a>
        then selecting TB from the list of reportable diseases.</p>
    <p>Public
        health authorities collect data about reported TB cases including demographic, clinical, risk factor, and
        contact information, which
        are analyzed to describe the distribution of the disease among Georgia’s population, identify high risk groups
        and TB clusters, describe trends in morbidity, mortality, drug resistance patterns, treatment outcomes, and
        infection rates among contacts to TB cases. The data are used at state and local levels to guide policy and
        decision making, set priorities for program interventions, evaluate program performance for the prevention
        and control of TB in Georgia, and educate key stakeholders and the general public on TB. Georgia’s TB
        surveillance data are transmitted electronically to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
        and become part of the national TB surveillance database.</p>
    <p>Latent TB
        infection in young children (under age 5) is also reportable in Georgia. Young children with latent TB
        infection are at very high risk of developing active TB including TB meningitis. These children have, by
        definition, been recently exposed to an adult with contagious TB. And there are often additional young children
        who have also been exposed. Rapid public health response will address both of these concerns.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>ALL Latent TB infection (LTBI) in children under 5 years of age </b>must be
            reported to the public health department in the county where the patient resides.
        </li>
        <li><b>A source Case Investigation </b>will be conducted by the health department
            when LTBI is found in a child under 5 years old.
        </li>
    </ul>
