            All patients with culture-confirmed TB should have phenotypic DST performed. However, these tests are
            limited by a
            long turnaround time.
        </li>
        <li>Several genotypic DST are available, and the Xpert MTB/RIF
            is the mostly commonly used in the U.S. with turnaround
            time < 1 day.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity and specificity for rifampin-resistant
        TB is > 92% and 99%, respectively. However, given the low incidence of rifampin resistance in the U.S., Xpert
        MTB/RIF positive
        predictive value is low. Pre-test probability for rifampin resistance is increased among patients with prior TB
        treatment and
        patients with prolonged stay in high burden TB countries. A test
        result indicating rifampin resistance should prompt consultation
        with a TB expert (see <a href="15_appendix_district_tb_coordinators_(by_district).html">Appendix</a>). </p>
