        <p>Table 7 Notes</p>
        <p>NOTE: 1 Daily DOT = 5 days/week (Monday through Friday). Self administered doses (including those on
            weekends) will not be counted toward the total doses.</p>
        <p>NOTE 2: Regimen 1a is the preferred regimen for patients with newly diagnosed TB.</p>
        <p>NOTE 3: Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) 25 - 50 mg/daily should be added to all regimens that include isoniazid
            (INH) in adults to prevent development of INH- induced peripheral neuropathy. For patients with pre-existing
            peripheral neuropathy, increase pyridoxine dose to 100 mg/day unless there is abnormal renal function.</p>
        <p>^NOTE: Duration of therapy for patients with drug-susceptible TB should be extended to 9 months (31 weeks
            continuation phase, 39 weeks total) for patients who have cavitary pulmonary TB and remain sputum culture
            positive after 2 months of therapy. Many experts would extend therapy to 9 months for all patients with
            HIV/TB, especially those slow to convert to negative cultures or not on effective HIV treatment.</p>
        <p>*NOTE: Option 2 should NOT be used for patients with HIV infection, cavitary pulmonary TB, disseminated TB,
            vertebral TB or for patients who have co-morbid medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, end- stage
            renal disease or liver disease.</p>
        <p>NOTE: Split dosing should be avoided.</p>
        <p>NOTE: Refer to current drug reference or drug package insert for a complete
            list of adverse drug reactions and drug interaction.</p>
