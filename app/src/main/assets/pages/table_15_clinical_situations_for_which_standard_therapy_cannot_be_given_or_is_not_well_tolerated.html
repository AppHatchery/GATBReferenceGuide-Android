            guidelines. Drug-susceptibility testing for second-line drugs should be requested if these agents are
            used.</P>

        <p>3-Associated with peripheral neuropathy. Add B6 ≥50 mg/daily</p>
        <p>4-Associated with irreversible peripheral and optic neuritis. Add B6 ≥ 50 mg/daily</p>
        <p>5-Associated with otovestibular toxicity</p>
        <p>6-These recommendations are meant for patients with known drug-susceptible TB or at low risk for drug-
            resistant TB</p>
