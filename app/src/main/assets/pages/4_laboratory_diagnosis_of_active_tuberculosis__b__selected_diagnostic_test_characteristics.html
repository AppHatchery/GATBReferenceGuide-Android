                <li>Turnaround time is usually < 1 day.</li>
                <li>AFB positive smears are not specific for Mycobacterium
                    tuberculosis. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria can also lead
                    to positive AFB smears.

            <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
                <li>Most laboratories use both solid and liquid culture media.</li>
                <li>Growth can be detected as late as 8 weeks in either media.</li>
                <li>Average time to culture positivity in solid cultures is 3-4 weeks and 10-14 days in liquid
                    media.
                </li>
                <li>Positive cultures are required for phenotypic drugsusceptibility testing and genotyping.

        <li>Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)
            <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
                <li>Turnaround time is usually < 1 day if the laboratory is able
                    to run the test frequently.
                </li>
                <li>Several FDA and non-FDA approved NAATs are available
                    and performance characteristics are variable.
                </li>
                <li>Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF (“Xpert MTB/RIF”) and Hologic
                    Amplified Mycobacteria Tuberculosis Direct (“MTD”)
                    NAATs are endorsed by ATS/IDSA/CDC guidelines.
                </li>
                <li>A positive AFB smear with negative Xpert MTB/RIF or
                    MTD NAAT usually indicates presence of non-tuberculous
                    mycobacteria in the sample.
                </li>
                <li>Xpert MTB/RIF also tests for genotypic evidence of rifampin susceptibility.</li>

        <li>Histopathology
            <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
                <li>Necrotizing granulomas in the appropriate clinical scenario should prompt strong
                    consideration for TB.
                </li>
                <li>Necrotizing granulomas are an immune reaction to TB
                    antigens and therefore are less likely to occur among immunosuppressed patients.
                </li>
                <li>Absence of histopathological signs of inflammation should
                    prompt concern for inadequate sampling.
