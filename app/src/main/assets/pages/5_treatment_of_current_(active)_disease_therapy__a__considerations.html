        <li><strong>The provider (or public health program)</strong> is responsible for prescribing an appropriate
            regimen
            and ensuring that treatment is completed successfully. <strong>Proven or suspected active TB must be
                reported
                to the local health department at the time treatment is initiated.</strong> The health department can
            assist
            with (or assume responsibility for if the clinician prefers) managing the TB treatment. The TB program can
            also
            provide access to TB experts throughout the state. <strong>Contact information for TB coordinators in each
                county is found in the (LINK TO ANOTHER CHAPTER!) -&gt;&gt; Appendix and at</strong> &nbsp;the <a
                    href="https://dph.georgia.gov/public-health-districts">DPH website </a></li>


        <li><strong>The decision to initiate treatment for active TB is often (appropriately) made prior to the
            confirmation
            of the diag- nosis. Numerous factors are considered in making this decision and are outlined in (Link to
            another
            TB Page!) -&gt;&gt; Figure 1 on page 54.</strong></li>

        <li>Early or immediate reporting to the county health department or state TB program is indicated for:</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Suspected or documented drug resistance</li>
            <li>Patients with molecular test indicating rifampin resistance</li>
            <li>Patients with prior treatment for active TB</li>
            <li>Patients failing treatment for active TB</li>
            <li>Life-threatening illness from suspected (or documented) active TB (i.e., meningitis or ICU admission)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) to ensure adherence and treatment completion is the standard of care
            for
            all pa- tients with active TB. DOT</strong> is managed by the county public health department. A variety of
            approaches to DOT, including Video-DOT, are employed by our TB program. The Georgia DPH TB Control Program
            provides patient-centered care for all patients. Treatment is tailored and supervised based on each
            patient’s
            clinical and social circumstances. TB treatment is most successful within a comprehensive framework that
            addresses both clinical and social issues of relevance to the patient.
        </li>

        <li>Drug susceptibility testing should be performed on initial M. tuberculosis isolates in ALL cases. Drug
            susceptibility testing and AFB cultures are performed by the Georgia Public Health Laboratory (Phone:
            404-327-7945 or 404-327-7946).
        </li>

        <li>The best way to measure the effectiveness of therapy for pulmonary TB is to monitor patients
            bacteriologically
            through sputum examination at least monthly until two con- secutive negative cultures are obtained. We
            recommend
            obtaining monthly sputum examinations throughout the course of therapy. For patients with pulmonary TB, it
            is
            essential to obtain a culture at the time when 2 months of therapy have been completed “the 2-month
            culture.”
        </li>

        <li>Patients being treated for uncomplicated pulmonary TB do not require frequent chest x-rays; bacteriologic
            examination is far more important than monitoring chest radiographs.
        </li>

        <li>If a patient’s sputum cultures remain positive beyond 2 months of therapy, the possibility of drug-resistant
            disease, malabsorption, or patient non-adherence to taking medications as prescribed should be considered.
            Drug
            susceptibility testing studies should be repeated, and care should be re- viewed with experts.
        </li>

        <li>Adjust weight-based doses as weight changes.</li>
