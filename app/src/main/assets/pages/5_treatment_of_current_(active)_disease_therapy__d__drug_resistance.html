    <p>Seek expert consultation for all patients with suspected or proven drug-resistant TB. Treatment of TB caused by
        drug-
        resistant organisms should be done by or in close consultation with an expert in the management of these
        difficult
        situations. INH-resistant TB is the most common form of drug-resistant TB (with a global prevalence of >10%).
        Newly
        updated ATS/CDC/ IDSA recommendations for the treatment of drug-resistant TB recommend the addition of later
        generation fluoroquinolones (i.e., levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) to rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for
        the
        treatment of INH-resistant TB, although there are limited data on the benefit of the addition of the
        fluoroquinolone
        in these circumstances. Multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB is defined as resistance to at least INH and rifampin. New
        and
        repurposed anti-TB drugs included in treatment regimens have provided new options for the treatment of MDR-TB.
        As
        noted, consultation with an expert is required for MDR-TB and other drug-resistant TB cases. Second line
        treatment
        regimens often represent the patientâ€™s last best hope for being cured. Inappropriate management can have
        life-threatening consequences. See <a href="15_appendix_district_tb_coordinators_(by_district).html">Appendix</a> and/or website for making contact with an appropriate expert in
        your
        county:<a href="https://dph.georgia.gov/district-health-directors">https://dph.georgia.gov/district-health-directors</a>
