    <p>HIV is the most important risk factor for active TB disease and TB-related mortality. TB is one of the few
        co-infections occurring in HIV-infected persons which is transmissible, curable and preventable. Importantly,
        HIV is
        a risk factor for active TB across all CD4 count levels.</p>

    <p>Persons with HIV infection may have diminished (or absent) tuberculin skin test reaction and/or negative IGRA
        because of immunosuppression. Therefore, tuberculin reactions of > 5 mm of induration are considered indicative
        of
        TB infection in an HIV- infected individual (see <a href="2_diagnostic_tests_for_latent_tb_infection_(ltbi)__b__criteria_for_a_positive_tuberculin_test_by_risk_group.html"> B. Criteria for a Positive Tuberculin Test, by Risk Group</a>). Standard IGRA cut-offs apply for patients
        with
        HIV despite reduced sensitivity of IGRA test among patients with HIV.</p>

    <p>Because HIV status is a critical factor in the treatment of TB, HIV counseling and testing should be offered to
        all
        patients with proven or suspected active TB disease.</p>

    <P>The clinical presentation of TB in a person living with HIV may differ from that in persons without HIV. Apical
        pulmonary disease with cavitation, a classic finding in immunologically competent persons, is less common among
        persons living with HIV, especially among those with low CD4 counts. HIV-infected patients may present with
        infiltrates in any lung zone and/or with mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Extrapulmonary and disseminated
        TB
        are common among HIV-infected TB patients.
    </P>

    <h4>Treatment for Individuals with TB & HIV</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The treatment of TB in persons living with HIV is similar to that for patients without HIV infection.
            However,
            intermittent therapy should be avoided, and twice-weekly regimens are contraindicated.
        </li>

        <li>Persons living with HIV with active TB disease should be initiated on a 4-drug treatment regimen (INH, RIF
            (or
            Rifabutin), PZA and EMB) and pyridoxine as outlined in <a href="table_7_recommended_regimens_for_treatment_of_adults_and_children_with_drug_susceptible_tb_pulmonary_tb.html">Table 7</a>, unless contraindications to
            medication exist. The use of antiretroviral therapy and TB medications is discussed on <a href="5_treatment_of_current_(active)_disease_therapy__g__antiretroviral_therapy_(art)_and_treatment_of_persons.html">Antiretroviral Therapy During the Course of TB Therapy</a>.
            Persons living with HIV with drug-susceptible TB disease generally respond well to standard anti-TB drugs.
        </li>

        <li>Patients with HIV co-infection who have drug-susceptible TB disease should be treated for a minimum of 6 months with antituberculosis therapy. Duration of therapy should be prolonged for patients with delayed or slow
            response to therapy. Persons living with HIV with TB disease should be monitored closely for clinical and
            bacteriological response. Many experts extend treatment duration to 9 months for all patients with HIV, but
            prolonged treatment beyond 6 months is especially recommended for patients who do not achieve HIV viral
            suppression during TB treatment and/or are slow to respond to therapy, including patients who remain culture
            positive after two months of therapy. Because patient adherence to therapy is critical for good outcomes,
            DOT is
            the standard of care and is strongly recommended for all patients with active TB including persons living
            with
            HIV.
        </li>

        <li>Persons living with HIV with TB disease should be monitored very closely during therapy as they appear to
            have a
            greater frequency of adverse reactions to anti-TB drugs.
        </li>

        <li>HIV viral load should be monitored very closely during TB therapy given drug-drug interactions. Viral load
            should be measured prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and within 2â€”4 weeks but no later than 8
            weeks after ART initiation. An HIV viral load should be measured every 3 months among patients with stable
            ART
            regimen and suppressed viral load.
        </li>

        <li>After treatment for TB disease is completed, patients should be reminded that if symptoms reappear, they
            should
            seek prompt medical evaluation.
        </li>
    </ol>
