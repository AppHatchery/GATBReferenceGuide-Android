        <li><b>Patients with suspected extrapulmonary TB</b> should always
            be evaluated for concomitant pulmonary TB with at least
            CXR and sputum smear and culture.
        </li>
        <li>Tissue biopsies are aerosol-generating procedures, and
            infection control measures for airborne pathogens should
            be observed in cases of suspected TB.
        </li>
        <li>Sensitivity of smear, culture, and NAAT tests are generally
            reduced for extrapulmonary samples compared to sputum
            samples.
        </li>
        <li>NAATs can be performed in extrapulmonary samples. However, NAATs are not FDA-approved for extrapulmonary
            samples, and negative results should be interpreted with caution. Extra-pulmonary samples are more likely to
            contain PCR inhibitors, and clinicians should discuss test validity
            (i.e., positive-control results) with laboratory.
        </li>
        <li><b>Diagnostic tests have low sensitivity for central nervous
            system TB.</b> Cerebrospinal fluid AFB smear sensitivity is very
            low (< 5%), and culture and Xpert MTB/RIF both have sensitivity < 70%.
        </li>
        <li>Pleural <i>tissue</i> histopathological exam sensitivity is > 70%,
            whereas pleural fluid and pleural tissue smear sensitivity are
            < 10% and < 40%, respectively. Pleural fluid and pleural tissue culture sensitivity are < 70%
        </li>
        <li>Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is as an appropriate diagnostic
            test for suspected TB lymphadenitis. However, excisional
            biopsy has higher yield and should be pursued when FNA
            results are negative and suspicion for TB remains high.
        </li>
        <li>Consider obtaining adenosine deaminase (ADA) pleural, pericardial, peritoneal, or meningeal fluid in
            addition to smear,
            culture, and NAAT. However, ADA result should be interpreted with caution as sensitivity and specificity are
            highly
            influenced by cut-off values and anatomical sample source.
