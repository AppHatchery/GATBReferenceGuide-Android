        <b> Diagnostic testing for LTBI should be targeted</b> at those who are
        <b>at increased</b> risk for having LTBI and those who if infected with
        M. tuberculosis are at increased risk of progression to active TB
        disease (see <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>). HIV-infected persons with LTBI
        have the greatest risk of progressing to active TB (at rates up to 8
        -10% per year). All persons living with HIV should undergo testing
        for LTBI, and if LTBI is found, should strongly be encouraged to
        initiate and complete treatment for LTBI. <br>
        Patients who take <b>immunomodulating drugs</b> are also at very high risk
        for progression to active TB if infected with M. tuberculosis. This includes patients with LTBI who are treated
        with TNF-α inhibitors such as
        infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), adalimumab (Humira),
        certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), or golimumab (Simponi). Following
        the initial introduction of TNF-α inhibitor drugs, there were reports of the subsequent development of
        extrapulmonary and disseminated disease and in some cases, death. <br>
        All patients who will be treated with TNF-α inhibitor drugs should be screened for
        LTBI before starting the medication; if found to have LTBI, they
        should be started on therapy for LTBI (after active TB is excluded)
        before starting the TNF-α inhibitor. Whether treatment for LTBI
        should be completed before a TNF-α inhibitor is started is controversial. Patients preparing to receive a <b>solid
        organ transplant</b> should also be screened for LTBI. <br>
        There is no official guidance regarding LTBI testing <b></b>pre-bone marrow transplant</b>. Current clinical practice among
        experts is to use targeted testing for LTBI based on epidemiologic risk factors.
        Children less than 5 years of age are at increased risk for progression to active TB disease if
        infected but should not be tested for LTBI unless they are at increased risk for TB exposure (see <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>).
        Persons who recently converted to a positive skin test (or positive IGRA) should be medically evaluated, and
        active TB disease ruled out (see <a href="2_diagnostic_tests_for_latent_tb_infection_(ltbi)__g__medical_evaluation_after_testing_for_ltbi.html">section II. G. page 21</a>) and LTBI treatment considered. Also, persons with
        a chest radiograph suggestive of old TB are at increased risk for
        progression to active TB disease.
    </p>

    <h4>Who should be targeted for LTBI testing? </h4>
    <p>Diagnostic tests for LTBI are not recommended for people with
        low risk of infection with M. tuberculosis. Testing of low-risk persons can result in false-positive tests.
        Certain persons with increased risk of developing TB if they have LTBI should be targeted for testing. These
        include: </p>
    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
        <li>People who have spent time with someone who has TB disease (contacts of active TB cases)</li>
        <li>People living with HIV or those who have other immunecompromising illnessesImmigrants from high TB incidence
            countries (e.g., Asia, Africa, most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, and Russia)
        </li>
        <li>People who live or work somewhere in the United States where TB disease is more common (homeless shelters,
            correctional facilities including prisons and jails, or some nursing homes)
        </li>
        <li>People who use illegal drugs, especially injection drug users</li>
        <li>People who are preparing to initiate treatment with a TNF-α inhibitor.</li>
        <li>People preparing to receive a solid organ transplant or hematopoetic stem cell transplant.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Recommendations for Screening for Latent TB Infection
        (LTBI):</b>
    <br>
    The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends
    testing populations that are at increased risk for TB infection
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening" class="res-width">
            (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening)</a>
    </p>
    This is a “B” recommendation (“offer or provide this
    service”) indicating that given the current evidence, the USPSTF
    has concluded with moderate certainty that benefits of screening
    for LTBI in people who are at increased risk of infection outweigh
    the potential harms. However, the highest-risk populations and
    thus those with the greatest benefit for targeted screening and
    treatment (persons living with HIV, close contacts of persons
    with active TB, and those being treated with immunosuppressive
    agents such as TNF-α inhibitors) were excluded from the USPSTF
    review of evidence because “screening in these populations may
    be considered standard care as part of disease management or
    indicated prior to the use of certain medications.” Once these
    highest-risk groups which should be screened for LTBI are removed, patients considered high risk in the primary
    care setting
    that should be screened for LTBI include non-U.S. born persons
    who have immigrated to the U.S. from high burden TB countries.

        testing and treatment are outlined above and also listed in

        <p><b>Testing of low risk individuals for LTBI is discouraged</b> because
            false-positive results are more likely to occur in this setting. Because QFT, TSPOT, and TST each measure
            different aspects of the immune response and use different antigens and interpretation criteria, test
            results might not be interchangeable. Different
            tests can yield different results. Studies which employed multiple
            diagnostic tests have demonstrated that discordant test results
            are not uncommon.</p>

        <h4>Which diagnostic test for LTBI should be used? </h4>
        <b>General Recommendations for Use of Diagnostic Tests for LTBI: </b>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
            <li>ATS/CDC/IDSA guidelines [Clin Infect Dis 2017; 64(2):111–5]
                note that either an FDA-approved IGRA (i.e., QFT or TSPOT)
                or TST can be used for diagnostic testing, and use of either
                test is an acceptable medical and public health practice. As
                <b>noted below, there are preferences and special circumstances in which one of these tests may be
                    preferred</b>.
            </li>
            <li>The ATS/CDC/IDSA guidelines note that “There are insufficient data to recommend a preference for either
                a TST or an
                IGRA as the first-line diagnostic test in individuals 5 years or
                older who are likely to be infected with M. tuberculosis, who
                have a high risk of progression to disease, and in whom it
                has been determined that diagnostic testing for LTBI is warranted.”
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Situations in which an IGRA is preferred but a TST is acceptable: </b>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
            <li>Testing of BCG-vaccinated persons (because of improved
                specificity of the IGRA vs. TST in this population)
            </li>
            <li>Testing of persons who may be unlikely to return to have the
                TST read (e.g., homeless individuals and injection drug users
                or those with substance abuse)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Situations in which a TST is preferred but an IGRA is acceptable: </b>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
            <li>Testing children aged < 5 years (TST is recommended by the
                American Academy of Pediatrics)
            </li>
            <li>Serial testing (e.g., for selected health care workers). While
                not a CDC recommendation, we recommend that the TST be
                used for serial testing programs. Several reports have indicated very high rates of diagnostic test
                "conversion" (e.g., up
                to 10-fold higher than the TST) when IGRAs were used for
                serial testing of health care workers in low-risk/lowprevalence situations in the U.S. and Canada (thus
                suggesting the IGRA results were false positive). Most health care
                workers in the U.S. are at low risk for occupational infection
                with M. tuberculosis and national guidelines on serial testing
                of health care workers have recently been updated by CDC
                based on the changing epidemiology of TB in the U.S. over
                the past few decades. These updated CDC guidelines no
                longer recommend routine serial screening of low-risk U.S.
                health care workers in the absence of exposure or ongoing
                transmission. Baseline testing at the time of employment is
                recommended.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Situations in which a TST or IGRA may be used without preference: </b>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
            <li>Contact investigations (i.e., testing of recent contacts of
                persons known or suspected to have active TB)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Situations in which testing with both an IGRA and a TST may be
            considered: </b>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
            <li>When additional evidence of infection is required to encourage a person that they have LTBI and should
                take and adhere
                to therapy for LTBI (e.g., foreign-born health care worker
                who believes that their positive TST result is attributable to
                BCG)
            </li>
            <li>When the initial diagnostic test performed in a healthy person at low risk for both infection and
                progression is positive
                (and thought to be a false positive). This situation could be
                prevented by using targeted testing and not testing low risk
                individuals.
            </li>
            <li>Repeating an IGRA or performing a TST might be useful
                when the initial IGRA result is indeterminate, borderline, or
                invalid and a reason for testing persists.
            </li>
            <li>In selected very high-risk individuals when missing the presence of LTBI could have serious consequences
                (e.g., individuals to be started on a TNF-α blocker or other immunocompromising medications).
