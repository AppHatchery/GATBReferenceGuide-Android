    <p> The GA TB
        program has a contract with the American Lung Association of GA (ALAG) to provide alternative housing and
        basic necessities (meals, personal supplies, transportation, and social services) for patients without these
        resources.</p>
    <p> Hundreds of
        tuberculosis patients have utilized the Alternative Housing Program since 1996. The Program utilizes inexpensive
        motels, trailers, duplexes, apartments and houses. The Health Departments provide DOT and transportation to TB
        and Ryan White clinic appointments. In 2005, ALAG began to extend its services to provide housing services for
        non-infectious clients in addition to infectious clients.</p>
    <p> The plan to
        place homeless patients in area housing requires frequent communication among ALAG area hospitals, and county TB
        Clinics. In addition to the formal agreements between ALAG and rental establishments, letters of agreements are
        on file from all participating districts. These letters demonstrate a commitment to the Alternative Housing
        Program by each District TB Program. Monthly patient care reviews are mandatory to ensure that continuity of
        care is maintained and other needed services are being provided. A designated Outreach Worker (ORW) provide
        DOT and patient follow-up.</p>
