        Health department staff are trained and experienced in contact investigation, provision of directly observed
        treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) and directly observed therapy (DOT) for the treatment of patients with
        active disease. Physicians with expertise in treating TB are part of the health department team in each
        county. <b>DOT is the standard of care for all patients with TB disease in Georgia and is strongly recommended
        for all patients with tuberculosis to facilitate adherence and completion of therapy.</b></p>
    <p>
        Early reporting of suspected or confirmed TB cases is important for control of TB and <u>is required by law</u>.
        Reporting gives the clinician access to the resources of the public health department for assistance in case
        management and contact investigation and consultation with expert TB clinicians. Contact investigations are
        indicated to determine those who have been exposed to infectious TB patients so close contacts can be
        evaluated for evidence of active or latent TB and treatment provided as indicated.</p>
    <p>
        Tuberculosis services (radiology, medical consultations, DOT, etc.) are available in every health district. All
        TB medications are provided by the state pharmacy free of charge.</p>
