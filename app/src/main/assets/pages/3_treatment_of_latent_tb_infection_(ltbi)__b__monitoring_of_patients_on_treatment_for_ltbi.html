    <h4>For all patients (based on CDC recommendations):</h4>
    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
        <li> Evaluate for active TB disease both before and during treatment of LTBI.</li>
        <li>Inform the patient or parents or legal guardians about possible adverse effects of the LTBI treatment
            regimen and instruct them to seek prompt medical attention when symptoms of possible adverse reaction first
            appear; particularly
            drug hypersensitivity reactions, rash, hypotension, or signs
            of thrombocytopenia (see <a
                    href="table_6_ltbi_treatment_drug_adverse_reactions.html">Table
                6</a>).
        </li>
        <li>Conduct monthly evaluations to assess treatment adherence
            and adverse effects, with repeated patient education regarding adverse effects at each visit.
        </li>
        <li>For those on self-administered therapy, never dispense
            more than one month of therapy (and no refills). Include
            careful questioning about side effects and a brief physical
            examination checking for evidence of hepatitis or other side
            effects during each visit.
        </li>
        <li>Order baseline hepatic chemistry blood tests (AST or ALT)
            for patients with the following specific conditions: HIV infection, liver disorders, postpartum period (≤ 3
            months after
            delivery), regular alcohol use, injection drug use, or use of
            medications with known possible interactions. (We prefer to
            obtain a baseline laboratory chemistry profile including a
            hepatic chemistry blood test on all adult patients starting
            LTBI therapy.)
        </li>
        <li>In the absence of liver disease or HIV infection, children on
            LTBI therapy do not need monthly ALT or AST monitoring.
        </li>
        <li>Conduct blood tests at subsequent clinical encounters for
            patients whose baseline testing is abnormal and for others at
            risk for liver disease. Discontinue the LTBI treatment regimen if a serum AST concentration is ≥ 5 times the
            upper
            limit of normal in the absence of symptoms or ≥ 3 times the
            upper limit of normal in the presence of symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>In case of a possible severe adverse reaction, discontinue
            the LTBI regimen immediately and provide supportive medical care. Conservative management and continuation
            of LTBI
            therapy under observation can be considered in the presence of mild to moderate adverse events as determined
            by
            the health care provider.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Indications for regular monthly monitoring of LFTs:</h4>
    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
        <li>Abnormal ALT (or AST) at baseline</li>
        <li>HIV infection</li>
        <li>Pregnancy</li>
        <li>First three months postpartum</li>
        <li>Chronic liver disease (including hepatitis C virus [HCV] infection)</li>
        <li>Regular alcohol use</li>
        <li>Injection drug use</li>
        <li>Patients on other drugs which are potentially hepatotoxic</li>
        <li>Advanced age</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Medication should be discontinued, and patient evaluated if:</h4>
    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
        <li>Transaminase levels (i.e., ALT or AST) > 3 times upper limit of
            normal in the presence of symptoms of adverse events
        </li>
        <li>Transaminase levels (i.e., ALT or AST) > 5 times upper limit of
            normal in an asymptomatic patient
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="uk-text-bold"><i>Pyridoxine</i></span> (Vitamin B6) should be used (25-50 mg/day) with INH
        for persons with conditions in which neuropathy is common (e.g.,
        HIV, diabetes, alcoholism, malnutrition) as well as pregnant women and persons with a seizure disorder to
        prevent isoniazidassociated neuropathy. It should be given to all HIV-infected
        persons, all children, and women who are breastfeeding. For
        healthy individuals on a normal diet, pyridoxine is optional. However, we prefer to give pyridoxine to all
        patients on INH. Pyridoxine (at 25 mg per day) is also recommended for children on INH.</p>
