    <p>*Preliminary data suggest that there is an increased risk of neural tube defects in infants born to women
        who were receiving DTG at the time of conception. DTG is contraindicated for pregnant women during first
        trimester and for women who are planning to become pregnant or are not using effective contraception.
        DTG is the preferred integrase inhibitor after first trimester.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>NNRTIs: non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</li>
        <li>PIs: protease inhibitors</li>
        <li>ATV/r: Atazanavir/ritonavir</li>
        <li>DRV/r: Daraunavir/ritonavir</li>
        <li>LPV/r: Lopinavir/ritonavir</li>
        <li>RAL: Raltegravir</li>
        <li>DTG: Dolutegravir</li>
        <li>/c : boosted with cobicistat</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Table 18 is based on guidelines developed by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Panel on
        Guidelines for Use of Antiretroviral Agents for Adults and Adolescents and Use of Antiretroviral Drugs
        in Pregnant Women with HIV Infection and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal Transmission in the United
        States, last reviewed and updated April 15, 2019
        <a href="http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines">(aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines)</a></p>

    <p>1-Data on integrase inhibitors and pregnancy outcomes is rapidly evolving and DHHS
        guidelines are frequently updated.</p>

    <p>2-Cobicistat is currently not recommended for pregnant women.</p>
