        <li>Response to Treatment</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>For patients with pulmonary TB, obtain sputum for AFB smear and culture at least monthly until two
                consecutive sputum samples are culture negative. Some authorities prefer to obtain monthly AFB sputum
                smear
                and cultures throughout the course of therapy.
            </li>

            <li>Patients with cavitary pulmonary TB who have a positive 2 -month sputum culture are at increased risk
                for
                relapse if treated with only 6 months of therapy. If the 2-month culture remains positive or if symptoms
                do
                not resolve, request repeat drug susceptibility testing to evaluate for acquired drug resistance.
                Additionally, review information related to treatment adherence. For any patient receiving
                self-administered
                therapy (this should be very rare as DOT is our standard of care) who has a positive 2-month culture,
                DOT
                should be initiated.
            </li>

            <li>For patients with drug susceptible disease who have positive 2-month culture and have cavitary disease
                on
                their initial CXR, the continuation phase should be increased to 7 months so that they receive a total
                of 9
                months of therapy.
            </li>

            <li>Factors to be considered in deciding whether to prolong treatment in patients with either cavitation on
                initial CXR or a positive culture after 2 months of therapy (but not both) include being more than 10%
                underweight at diagnosis, having HIV infection or having extensive involvement on CXR.
            </li>
            <li>HIV testing should be performed on all persons diagnosed with TB.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Monitoring for Adverse Reactions</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Obtain the following baseline measurements to detect any abnormality that would complicate the regimen
                or
                necessitate its modification:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Hepaticenzyme (e.g.,AST) level, bilirubin, serumcreatinine, complete blood count and platelet count.
                </li>
                <li>Baseline visual acuity (if EMB is used)</li>
                <li>Baseline audiometry (if Amikacin is used).</li>
                <li>CD4 count and HIV viral load for patients with HIV infection.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Patients with epidemiologic risk factors for hepatitis B or C (e.g., injection drug use, birth in Asia
                or
                Africa, HIV infection) should have serologic tests for these viruses performed.
            </li>

            <li>All patients should be seen at least monthly and questioned about potential adverse reactions. If
                symptoms
                suggesting drug toxicity occur, appropriate laboratory testing should be performed to confirm or exclude
                such toxicity. Patients should be instructed to report symptoms of hepatitis (which can be induced by
                INH,
                RIF and/or PZA) immediately. Such symptoms include nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice (dark
                urine,
                yellow skin), malaise, unexplained fever for > 3 days, or abdominal tenderness. If patients have
                jaundice or
                symptoms of liver disease, discontinue medications immediately and consult a specialist.
            </li>

            <li>Routine monthly laboratory monitoring is generally not required for those with normal baseline and no
                underlying disease. Monitor hepatic enzymes monthly if baseline levels are elevated, and for those with
                HIV
                infection, history of alcoholism, chronic liver disease, concomitant use of other drugs which can cause
                hepatotoxicity, or pregnancy. At least 20% of patients will have elevated hepatic enzymes; asymptomatic
                elevation less than five times the upper limit of normal is not an indication to stop treatment in
                asymptomatic patients. If patients have jaundice or symptomatic liver disease, discontinue medications
                immediately and consult a specialist
            </li>

            <li>Patients receiving EMB should be questioned regarding visual disturbances at monthly intervals; monthly
                repeat testing of visual acuity and color vision is recommended for patients receiving an EMB dose
                exceeding
                15â€”20 mg/ kg (recommended range) and for patients receiving EMB for more than two months.
            </li>

            <li>Pyridoxine will usually prevent INH-induced neurotoxicity (peripheral neuropathy).</li>
            <li>Hyperuricemia may occur in patients on PZA but acute gout is uncommon. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not
                an
                indication for discontinuing the drug.
            </li>
