    <p>
        For TB control efforts, it is important that there be a smooth transition from the in-patient to the out-patient
        setting and close cooperation and coordination of activities among the wide variety of organizations involved in
        TB patient
        care, education and TB control.</p>
    <p>Minimum Criteria
        for discharge planning:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Patients have been initiated on treatment with an appropriate anti-TB regimen (e.g., 4-drug
            regimen) and are medically ready for discharge.
        </li>
        <li>All TB patients have their discharge endorsed in the chart <i>prior to discharge </i>by
            the hospital social worker and <b>the local health department liaison</b>.
        </li>
    </ul>
