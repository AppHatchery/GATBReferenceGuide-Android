<p>Adjunct corticosteroid therapy is indicated in the treatment of
    tuberculous meningitis as its use along with appropriate antituberculosis drugs is associated with a lower
    mortality. For pa- tients with tuberculous meningitis, dexamethasone or prednisolone is recommended for a total of 6
    to 8 weeks. An initial dose of 8 mg per day of dexamethasone for children < 25 kg and 12 mg per day for children >
    25 kg and adults can be used. The initial dose is given for 3 weeks and then the dose should be tapered during the
    following 3 weeks. Adjunctive corticosteroids in treatment of pericardial tuberculosis did not reduce mortality,
    tamponade or constrictive physiology in a large randomized clinical trial and are thus no longer routinely
    recommended. Some experts would use corticosteroids in selected patients with TB peri- carditis: those with large
    effusions and/or high levels of inflam- mation in pericardial fluid.</p>
