        <li>Initiate therapy with a 4-drug regimen as shown in (Table 7 on page 52).
            <p><b>Any patient who is started on treatment for suspected or proven active TB (even while still
                in
                the hospital) should be reported to local public health authorities at the time treatment is
                started.</b></p>
            <p>Therapy consists of an initiation phase and a continuation phase.</p>
            <p>The initiation phase generally consists of a 4-drug regimen given daily or 5 times per week per DOT. An
                option for twice weekly therapy by DOT after the initial 2 weeks of daily therapy (“Denver regimen”)
                also
                exists but is only rarely appropriate. This option should NOT be used for patients with HIV infection,
                cavitary pulmonary TB, disseminated TB, vertebral TB or for patients who have co-morbid medical
                conditions
                such as diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, or liver disease.</p>
            <p>The initiation phase is followed by a continuation phase. For drug susceptible disease, this can consist
                of
                daily, 5 times per week or thrice weekly by DOT (see Table 7). For patients with HIV co-infection, in
                the
                continuation phase, twice weekly therapy is contraindicated because of increased risk of relapse with
                rifampin-resistant disease; in such cases therapy should be given daily (or 5 times per week) or thrice
                weekly by DOT. In general, daily therapy is preferred throughout for patients with HIV co-infection or
                other
                immune-compromising conditions. See Figure 1 on page 54.</p>
            <p>See Tables 8 and 9, 10, 11, 12 on pages 56—62 for dosing recommendations for adults and children.</p>
        </li>

        <li>For patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, sputum specimens should be obtained at a minimum on a monthly
            basis
            until two consecutive specimens are culture negative (some obtain monthly specimens throughout the course of
            therapy). As discussed above, the 2-month culture is a critical data-point.
        </li>

        <li>Twice-weekly therapy is not recommended for use in the continuation phase by us and is contraindicated for
            treat- ment of persons living with HIV.
        </li>


        <li>Rifampin has many drug-drug interactions and may accelerate clearance of drugs metabolized by the liver
            including methadone, coumadin, glucocorticoids, estrogens, oral hypoglycemic agents, anticonvulsants,
            fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, cyclosporin, and protease inhibitors. Rifabutin can be used as a
            first
            line drug in place of rifampin for patients who are receiving medications, especially antiretroviral drugs,
            that
            have unacceptable interactions with rifampin.
            <ul>
                <li>Women taking RIF (or rifabutin) should use a barrier birth control method (and not rely on hormone
                    contraceptives alone).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>


        <li>Dose-counting: Although TB treatment regimens are generally described in terms of “months” of treatment, it
            is
            important that each patient receives an adequate number of doses. Thus, treatment completion is defined by
            number of doses actually taken as well as duration of treatment. The number of doses required for each
            regimen
            is listed in Table 7 on page 52.
        </li>

        <li>Follow-up after completion of therapy is generally not needed for patients who have had a satisfactory and
            prompt bacteriologic response and who have completed observed therapy with a 6- or 9-month INH- and
            RIF-containing regimen. Patients should be informed to seek prompt medical evaluation if symptoms reappear.
            Many
            authorities would continue to follow patients who are HIV-infected or who had drug-resistant isolates.
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>Precautions</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daily intake of alcohol increases the risk of hepatitis for patients taking INH.</li>
                <li>Neveraddasingledrugtoafailingregimen.</li>
                <li><strong>Directly observed therapy (DOT) is the standard of care for administering treatment of
                    active
                    TB, and such treatment should be supervised and coordinated by the local health
                    department. </strong>For
                    any patient on self- administered therapy, dispense only a 1-month supply of medicine at a time.
                </li>
