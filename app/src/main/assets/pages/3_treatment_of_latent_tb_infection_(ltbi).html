    <p>Treatment of LTBI is recommended for persons who are at increased risk for developing active TB disease. Those at
        increased
        risk for developing active TB disease following infection with M.
        tuberculosis are outlined in <a
                href="table_3_high_prevalence_and_high_risk_groups.html">Table
            3</a> and include persons living
        with HIV, those who are immunosuppressed and/or receiving
        immunosuppressive therapy (or scheduled to receive immunosuppressive therapy including TNF-α inhibitors), close
        contacts of persons with infectious active TB (e.g., pulmonary TB), others
        who are thought to have recent infection with M. tuberculosis
        (e.g., persons who have had a conversion from a negative to a
        positive diagnostic test for LTBI within the previous 2 years),
        immigrants and refugees from high TB burden countries, and
        children at risk who are < 5 years old. <br>
        The risk of serious disease,
        including miliary or disseminated TB and tuberculous meningitis,
        is highest among persons living with HIV, especially if they have
        advanced HIV/AIDS. Infants, the elderly, and patients with other
        causes of severe immunosuppression are also at increased risk
        for disseminated TB disease. Treatment for LTBI should be started only if clinical and radiographic evaluations
        exclude active TB
        disease. Persons with LTBI who are considered to be at high risk
        for developing active TB (see <a
                href="table_3_high_prevalence_and_high_risk_groups.html">Table
            3</a>) should be offered (and encouraged to take) treatment for LTBI
        irrespective of age. </p>
