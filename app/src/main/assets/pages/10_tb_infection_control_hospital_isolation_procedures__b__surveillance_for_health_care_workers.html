    <p>
        In general, the risk of occupational acquisition of TB is low among the large majority of US health care workers
        (HCWs) given the changing epidemiology of the disease in the U.S. The risk of TB exposure among most US-based
        health care workers (HCWs) is similar to the general population given the decreased TB incidence and improved
        hospital infection control measures in this country. Given the low risk among the vast majority of US HCWs,
        serial TB testing for US-based HCWs has been associated with a high rate of false-positive conversions.
        Therefore, CDC guidelines were updated in 2019 and no longer recommend routine serial testing for most US-based
        HCWs [MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2019;68:439–44.]. Guidelines continue to recommend baseline screening and
        testing in addition to an individual TB risk assessment to aid in TB test interpretation. All HCWs should have
        baseline test for LTBI (unless documented to be previously TST or IGRA positive or documented to have had prior
        TB disease). Two-step tuberculin skin testing upon employment is recommended unless the HCW had a TST in the
        prior year. Updated guidelines suggest health care facilities may consider serial testing in selected
        situations, such professionals at increased risk for exposure or selected areas in the facility where
        transmission has occurred and/or infection control lapses occur and infectious patients were present. If serial
        testing of HCWs is needed, we recommend the use of the TST rather than an IGRA for reasons described above (see
        pages 19—21 ). HCWs should be educated about the basic concepts of TB transmission and pathogenesis, infection
        control practices, signs and symptoms of TB, and risk for TB exposure in the facility annually.</p>
    <p>
        Following exposure, HCWs should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of TB. Those with a negative baseline test
        and no prior LTBI or TB should have a TST (or IGRA) performed. If the test is negative, a repeat test 8-10 weeks
        after the last exposure is recommended.</p>
    <p>
        Any worker who develops symptoms of active TB disease or whose test for LTBI (TST or IGRA) converts to positive
        should be evaluated promptly. Health care workers with recent TB infection on the basis of a conversion to a
        positive test for LTBI (regardless of age) and no evidence of active disease should be encouraged to take
        treatment for LTBI (see <a href="3_treatment_of_latent_tb_infection_(ltbi).html"> Treatment for LTBI</a>).</p>
