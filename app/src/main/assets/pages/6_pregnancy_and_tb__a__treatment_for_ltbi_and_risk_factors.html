    <p>A pregnant woman with a positive skin test and negative chest x-ray (a lead apron should cover the entire abdomen
        during x-ray) should be started on treatment for LTBI with INH (and B6) <i>immediately </i>if they have one or
        more of the following risk factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Documented recent
        tuberculin skin test conversion;</li>
            <li>HIV infection not receiving antiretroviral therapy or those with HIV risk factors who refuse HIV testing;</li>
            <li>Close contact of patient with AFB smear-positive pulmonary TB.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Pyridoxine (25â€”50 mg/d) is recommended for all pregnant or nursing mothers who receive INH. All pregnant and
        immediate post-partum patients should have a baseline and monthly liver function tests (e.g., AST or ALT)
        performed while on therapy. Treatment of other pregnant positive reactors can be deferred until several months
        after the completion of pregnancy.</p>
    <p>Among HIV-infected pregnant women on antiretroviral therapy, isoniazid preventive therapy is not recommended
        until after delivery (e.g., 3 months post-partum) unless they are close contacts of a known patient with
        active TB disease. This is due to recent study that demonstrated that he risks associated with initiation of
        isoniazid preventive therapy during pregnancy appeared to be greater than those associated with initiation of
        therapy during the postpartum period.</p>
