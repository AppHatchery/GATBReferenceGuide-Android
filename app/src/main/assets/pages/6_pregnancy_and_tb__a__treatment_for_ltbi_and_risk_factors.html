    <h4>Screening for LTBI</h4>
    <p>Testing asymptomatic patients for latent TB infection (LTBI) during pregnancy is indicated only for pregnant
        patients with
        significant risk factors for progression to active TB disease during pregnancy. High risk individuals are
        defined in
        <a href="2_diagnostic_tests_for_latent_tb_infection_(ltbi)__f__targeted_testing_and_diagnostic_tests_for_ltbi.html">Targeted
            Testing and Diagnostic Tests for LTBI</a>, including <a
                href="table_3_high_prevalence_and_high_risk_groups.html">Table 3</a>. This includes: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Those with recent contact with a patient with untreated active pulmonary TB)</li>
        <li>Persons living with HIV who are not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and those with CD4 count ≤200
            cells/mm3
        </li>
        <li>Patients with other significant immunocompromising conditions or on immunosuppressive medications</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Diagnostic evaluation after positive diagnostic test for LTBI</b>. Pregnant patients with a new positive
        diagnostic test
        for LTBI (i.e., <a href="2_diagnostic_tests_for_latent_tb_infection_(ltbi)__a__tuberculin_skin_test.html">tuberculin
            skin test [TST]</a> or <a
                href="2_diagnostic_tests_for_latent_tb_infection_(ltbi)__e__interferon_y_release_assays_(igras).html">Interferon-γ
            release assay [IGRA])</a> must undergo clinical evaluation to rule out
        active TB. This includes evaluation for TB-related symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, weight loss), physical exam,
        and a chest
        radiograph (a lead apron should cover the entire abdomen during the chest radiograph) regardless of gestational
        age. Some
        defer the chest radiograph until after the first trimester if the patient has no symptoms. Patients in whom
        there is a suspicion
        for active TB disease should be further evaluated as discussed in Section IV. Laboratory Diagnosis of Active
        Tuberculosis.
        Pregnant patients with active TB disease should be treated without delay as outlined <a
                href="6_pregnancy_and_tb__b__treatment_of_active_tb_in_pregnancy.html">below</a>. <i>Patients with a
            positive diagnostic
            test for LTBI (TST or IGRA) with no evidence of active TB may be presumed to have latent TB and should be
            managed as discussed below.</i></p>
    <p><b>Clinical manifestations</b>. Persons (including those who are pregnant) with LTBI are asymptomatic and not
        contagious. There is no risk for
        vertical transmission of LTBI from mother to fetus. </p>

    <p><b>Treatment of LTBI in Pregnancy.</b></p>
    <p><b>Timing of treatment.</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The potential of adverse effects associated with LTBI treatment during pregnancy must be weighed against the
            potential risks of progression to active TB during pregnancy.
        </li>
        <li>Pregnant women diagnosed with LTBI prior to pregnancy and started on treatment for LTBI for an appropriate
            indication should continue LTBI treatment during pregnancy;
            the regimen should be modified if necessary (e.g., 3HP is not recommended during pregnancy for the treatment
            of LTBI because of lack of data on its use in this setting).
        </li>
        <li>For many persons who are pregnant, not severely immunocompromised, and have LTBI, delay of treatment of LTBI
            until three months after delivery is recommended as discussed below.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For patients with significant immunocompromise (excluding HIV infection), the decision to treat during pregnancy
        or defer until after delivery should be based on individual clinical
        circumstances including the degree of immunocompromise. For those with significant immunocompromised status
        (e.g., organ transplantation, receiving a biologic agent, immunocompromising
        drugs such as prednisone >15 mg/d [or equivalent] for more than 1 month) treatment of LTBI during pregnancy is
        recommended. </p>
    <p>Persons living with HIV who are pregnant. The management of LTBI among pregnant women living with HIV depends on
        whether there was recent exposure to a patient with untreated active TB,
        as well as the HIV infection management status. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recent Exposure/LTBI. Treatment is recommended for all persons living with HIV (regardless of CD4 count)
            diagnosed with LTBI who are pregnant with recent exposure to a patient with
            untreated active respiratory TB given the increased risk of progression to active TB in such cases.
        </li>
        <li>Persons living with HIV not on antiretroviral therapy. Treatment of LTBI is recommend for those who are
            pregnant and living with HIV if they are not on antiretroviral therapy.
            Antiretroviral therapy should be started in this group.
        </li>
        <li>For pregnant persons living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy with CD4 count ≤350 cells/mm3, LTBI treatment
            during pregnancy is recommended given increased risk of progression
            to active TB. The CD4 cutoff for LTBI therapy is somewhat controversial; some experts favor a lower
            threshold (e.g., CD4 count ≤200 cells/mm3).
        </li>
        <li>For those pregnant persons living with HIV with a CD4 count >350 cells/mm3m, LTBI therapy should be deferred
            until three months after delivery.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The recommendation to defer LTBI therapy until three months after delivery is based on the results of a clinical
        trial (N Engl J Med 2019; 381:1333) demonstrating more frequent adverse
        pregnancy outcomes among patients in high TB incidence settings treated with isoniazid during pregnancy than
        among patients treated three months after delivery. The study included
        956 pregnant women living with HIV (CD4 count 351 to 670 cells/mm3 on antiretroviral thearpy) randomly assigned
        to initiate LTBI treatment with isoniazid immediately or defer
        treatment until 12 weeks after delivery. Study subjects were excluded if in the first trimester of pregnancy or
        if they had recent TB exposure; mothers and infants were followed
        for 48 weeks after delivery. The incidence of TB was comparable between the groups (0.60 versus 0.59 per 100
        person-years). However, the composite adverse pregnancy outcome
        (stillbirth or spontaneous abortion, low birth weight, preterm delivery, or congenital anomalies) was more
        commonly seen among those in the immediate LTBI treatment group compared to
        the deferred group (23.6% versus 17.0%). The rate of hepatotoxicity was similar between the groups (6.2 versus
        7.2 percent). The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines
        recommend delaying LTBI treatment among pregnant persons living with HIV until three months after delivery in
        the absence of a recent TB exposure, but do not specify a CD4 threshold. </p>
    <p><b>Recent TB infection</b>. For any pregnant woman with documented recent LTBI (e.g., exposure to a patient with
        untreated active pulmonary TB and documented recent infection based on an LTBI
        diagnostic test) or recent (within two years) conversion of a diagnostic test for TB infection to positive, LTBI
        treatment is recommended with one of three regimens mentioned below.</p>
    <p>HIV-uninfected Pregnant Women. For pregnant women without HIV infection who are not severely immunocompromised
        and have no recent exposure to a person with untreated active respiratory TB,
        it is recommended that LTBI treatment be deferred until three months after delivery, to minimize the risk of
        drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., from isoniazid) and adverse pregnancy outcomes
        associated with LTBI treatment during pregnancy. In such cases, close follow-up is required. For all pregnant
        persons with LTBI who have therapy deferred until three months after delivery,
        a follow-up evaluation for active TB disease (including chest radiograph) to confirm that active TB did not
        develop in the interval since diagnosis of LTBI and the time that treatment for LTBI
        begins should be carried out.</p>
    <p><b>Selecting an LTBI treatment regimen</b>. The same treatment regimens for LTBI that are used in non-pregnant
        persons can be used in pregnant and postpartum women with the EXCEPTION that 3HP
        (isoniazid plus rifapentine given weekly x 12 weeks) should NOT be used in pregnant and postpartum women because
        of lack of data in these settings. Options for CDC recommended LTBI regimens
        in pregnant and postpartum women include rifampin (for four months), isoniazid plus rifampin for 3 months, or
        isoniazid for 6-9 months. All pregnant persons receiving isoniazid for LTBI
        should also receive pyridoxine (vitamin B6) 50 mg po daily. </p>
