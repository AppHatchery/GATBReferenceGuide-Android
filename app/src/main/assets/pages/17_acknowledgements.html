        This booklet has been updated from the previous versions of the
        Georgia TB Reference Guide and was initially adapted from
        <i>Tuberculosis at a Glance, A Reference Guide for Practitioners
            Covering the Basic Elements of Tuberculosis Care</i>, designed and
        produced by the New York City Department of Health, Bureau of
        Tuberculosis Control. We extend a special thanks to Lisa
        Cranmer, MD, MPH, in the Division of Pediatric Infectious
        Diseases at Emory University for updating the childhood
