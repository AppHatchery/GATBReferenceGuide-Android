                <th>Principle: Despite drug interactions, a rifamycin (rifampin or rifabutin) should be included in TB
                    regimens for patients receiving ART, with dosage adjustment if necessary (see Table SMR11 for dosage
                    adjustments).

                <td>Option 1: Rifabutin-based
                    ART regimen: Integrase inhibitor and 2 NRTIs
                    Preferred ART choices: RAL or DTG + TDF/FTC
                    Alternative ART choices: DTG + ABC/3TC
                    Contraindicated medications: TAF, other integrase inhibitors (Bictegravir, Elvitegravir)
                    NOTE: Dolutegravir has higher barrier to resistance compared to raltegravir. Dolutegravir is
                    preferred when there is high risk poor adherence.

                <td>Option 2: Rifampin-based
                    ART regimen: Efavirenz and 2 NRTIs
                    Preferred ART choices: Efavirenz (NNRTI) + (TDF/FTC) Alternative ART choices: Efavirenz + ABC/3TC
                    Contraindicated medications: TAF, other NNRTIs: Nevaripine, Doravirine, Etravirine, or Rilpivirine
                    NOTE: Efavirenz is not a preferred regimen for patients initiating ART. Integrase inhibitors DTG and
                    RAL are preferred ART regimens for patients initiating ART but require BID dosing if used with
                    rifampin. Efavirenz has low barrier to resistance making this regimen less suitable when there is
                    high risk for poor adherence. Efavirenz is associated with neuropsychiatric side-effects. Screening
                    for depression and suicidality is recommended prior to and during efavirenz-based regimens.
                    Efavirenz + ABC/3TC is associated with higher rates of virologic failure when baseline HIV viral
                    load is >100.000 copies/ml.

                    ART regimen: boosted PI and 2 NRTIs
                    Preferred ART choices: ATV/r or ATV/c + TDF/FTC
                    DRV/r or DRV/c + TDF/FTC Alternative ART choices: ABC/3TC in place of TDF/FTC
                    Contraindicated medications: TAF
                    NOTE: PI’s have high barrier to resistance. However, given rifabutin is given at half-dose when used
                    with PI’s adherence to ART should be closely monitored. Poor adherence to PI’s while on rifabutin
                    increases risk for rifampin resistance.

                    TB regimen: Rifabutin –based (dose adjusted)
                    ART regimen: boosted PI (ARV/r or DRV/r) 2 + 2 NRTIs (TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC)
                    NOTE: Preliminary data suggest that there is an increased risk of neural tube defects in infants
                    born to women who were receiving DTG at the time of conception. DTG is contraindicated for pregnant
                    women during first trimester and for women who are planning to become pregnant or are not using
                    effective contraception. DTG is the preferred integrase inhibitor after first trimester 1.
