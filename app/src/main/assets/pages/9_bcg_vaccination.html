        Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is one of the most commonly used vaccines in the world and is given in
        the vast majority of low- and middle-income countries. BCG is recommended in higher TB incidence areas because
        it has a documented protective effect against TB meningitis and disseminated TB in young children. It does not
        prevent primary infection and, more importantly, does not prevent reactivation of latent pulmonary infection,
        the principal source of bacillary spread in the community. The impact of BCG vaccination on
        transmission of <i>M. tuberculosis </i>is therefore very limited (or there is no impact). BCG has not impacted
        the global epidemiology of TB. Because of variable efficacy, <i>BCG is NOT recommended for use in the U.S.
    </i>BCG is not a contraindication to a TST but as noted there can be cross reactions between BCG and the TST.
        The primary advantage of IGRAs is that they do not cross react with BCG. Interpretation of a tuberculin skin
        test reaction is not changed for patients who have received BCG. A reaction of <u>&gt;</u> 10 mm (<u>&gt;</u>
        5mm in HIV-infected persons) of induration should be considered infection with <i>M. tuberculosis </i>because:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conversion rates after BCG vaccination are not 100%;</li>
        <li>The mean reaction size among BCG vaccines are often less than 10 mm (a large reaction is more
            likely to be due to infection with M. tuberculosis than BCG vaccination);
        </li>
        <li>Tuberculin sensitivity tends to wane considerably after BCG vaccination; and,</li>
        <li>BCG is usually given in high TB incidence countries, so assume that the
            reaction is from infection, not vaccination.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Since many BCG-vaccinated persons come from areas of high TB incidence, it is important that persons with a
        positive TST be evaluated for presence of TB disease and managed accordingly. Appropriate follow-up includes a
        careful medical history, CXR to rule out active TB disease, and evaluation for treatment of LTBI. An IGRA is the
        preferred LTBI test among individuals with a history of BCG vaccination but a TST is an acceptable test in
        BCG-svaccinated persons.</p>
