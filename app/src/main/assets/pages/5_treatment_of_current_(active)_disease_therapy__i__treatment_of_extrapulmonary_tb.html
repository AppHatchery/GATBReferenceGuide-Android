    <p>The basic principles that underlie the treatment of pulmonary TB also apply to extrapulmonary forms of the
        disease. A
        6-month course of therapy is recommended for treating tuberculosis involving any site with the exception of the
        meninges for which a 9 – to 12-month regimen is recommended. Prolongation of therapy also should be considered
        for
        patients with tuberculosis in any site that is slow to respond. The addition of corticosteroids is recommended
        for
        patients with meningitis as it decreases mortality as discussed below.</p>

    <p>Lymphatic and hematogenous TB are especially common among persons with HIV infection. Central nervous system
        involvement has been reported and may be difficult to diagnose when it occurs in conjunction with other
        opportunistic CNS infections.</p>

    <p>To establish the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB, a variety of specimens including pleural fluid, peritoneal
        fluid,
        pleural and peritoneal biopsy specimens, lymph node tissue, bone marrow, bone, blood, urine, brain, or
        cerebrospinal
        fluid may need to be obtained for mycobacterial culture.</p>

    <p>Specimens must be examined microscopically and sent for AFB culture, but the inability to demonstrate AFB on
        smear
        and the absence of granuloma formation does not exclude the diagnosis of TB. Surgery may be necessary to obtain
        specimens for diagnosis and to treat such processes as constrictive pericarditis or spinal cord compression from
        Pott’s disease. Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of extrapulmonary TB and adjunctive use of
        corticosteroids are shown in Table 20 on pages 88-89.</p>
