    <p>Latent TB infection (LTBI) in children indicates recent transmission of TB in the community. Also, young children
        who are infected with TB are at high risk of progressing to TB disease. Because
        of the extreme importance of identifying children who have been
        exposed to and infected with TB, LTBI in a child less than 5
        years old is a notifiable disease in the state of Georgia. Cases
        may be reported electronically at <a href=" http://sendss.state.ga.us"> http://sendss.state.ga.us</a> by
        calling 1-866-782-4584, or by calling your local health department.</p>
