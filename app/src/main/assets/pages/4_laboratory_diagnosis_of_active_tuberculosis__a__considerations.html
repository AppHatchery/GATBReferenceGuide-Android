            Active TB diagnosis is usually pursued by mycobacterial acid
            -fast bacilli smear (“AFB smear”), mycobacterial culture (“AFB
            culture”), nucleic acid amplification tests, radiological exam,
            and histopathology.
        </li>

        <li>
            Phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing is optimal for patient
            care and genotyping is paramount for tuberculosis control.
            Both tests require an isolate from a positive culture. Thus,
            adequate samples for mycobacterial culture should be obtained whenever possible.
        </li>

        <li>
            Diagnostic samples can be collected after TB treatment initiation among patients with life-threatening
            disease or other
            compelling indications for immediate TB treatment (Figure
            1).
        </li>

        <li>
            TST and/or IGRA are negative in 10-30% of patients with
            active TB. <b>Thus, a negative TST and/or IGRA do not rule
            out active TB.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            The sensitivity of each test (smear, culture, and nucleic acid
            amplification) differs by sample source (e.g., sputum vs. cerebrospinal fluid).
        </li>
        <li>
            ATS/CDC/IDSA guidelines for Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in
            Adults and Children are a comprehensive source for laboratory tests for TB diagnosis [Lewinsohn et al.
            Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2017].
