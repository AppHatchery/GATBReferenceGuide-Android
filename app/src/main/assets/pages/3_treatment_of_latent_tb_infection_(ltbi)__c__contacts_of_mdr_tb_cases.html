    <p>There are no results from randomized controlled trials to guide
        therapy for persons with LTBI thought to be infected with MDRTB strains
        (although several studies are ongoing and such data should be available in the future).
        Several studies are ongoing which should provide
        more guidance in the future. In deciding how to treat persons
        with LTBI which may be due to infection with an MDR-TB strain,
        the following four questions should be considered.
        <b>A TB specialist should be consulted in the management of contacts to MDR-TB cases.</b>
    </p>
    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">

        <li>
            <b>How likely is it that a patient is newly TB infected? </b>A patient
            with a documented positive prior TST (or another diagnostic
            test such as an IGRA) is much less likely to be newly infected.
        </li>

        <li><b>How likely is it that the patient is infected with an MDR-TB
            strain?</b> An infant with a positive diagnostic test for LTBI
            (TST or IGRA) whose parent has active MDR-TB is highly
            likely to be infected with MDR-TB. In contrast, a health care
            worker with a positive TST and no known source case may
            have a low probability of being MDR-TB infected.
        </li>

        <li><b>How likely is the patient to develop active TB?</b> Those at highest risk include persons living with HIV
            or otherwise immunocompromised and children < 2 years of age.
        </li>

        <li><b>What is the drug-susceptibility pattern of the source patient’s isolate?</b> Treatment of LTBI must be
            tailored to the
            susceptibility pattern of the source patient’s isolate. When
            the source patient is known to have isoniazid-resistant TB,
            rifampin may be used for treatment of LTBI. As noted above,
            there are no current evidence-based guidelines for the
            treatment of LTBI when an individual is thought to be infected with an MDR-TB strain. In some cases of
            MDR-TB or
            XDR-TB, no LTBI regimen is available.
        </li>
