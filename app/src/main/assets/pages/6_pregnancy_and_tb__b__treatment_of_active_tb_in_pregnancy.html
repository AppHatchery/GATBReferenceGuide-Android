        <i><b>TB disease discovered during pregnancy should be treated without delay. </b></i>Because of the risk
            for tuberculosis to the fetus, treatment of TB in pregnant women should be initiated whenever the
            probability of maternal disease is moderate to high. Three sputum samples should be submitted for
            examination. The outcome of the cultures and susceptibility test results will determine the regimen for
            continuation of treatment.</p>

        <li>Drug Treatment in
        Pregnancy
        <ul>
            <li>The
        initial treatment regimen usually consists of INH, RIF and EMB; consideration should be given to including PZA.</li>
            <li>Although detailed teratogenicity data are not available, PZA can probably be used safely during pregnancy and is
        recommended for use by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and
        Lung Disease (IUATLD). In some U.S. jurisdictions, PZA has not been routinely recommended. PZA should be
        included in the initial regimen for HIV seropostive wom- en and for HIV seronegative women who are thought to be
        at high risk for drug resistant TB. If PZA is not includ- ed in the initial treatment regimen, the minimum dura-
        tion of therapy is 9 months.</li>
            <li>Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) (25 mg/d) is recommended for all pregnant women taking INH.</li>
            <li><i><b>Avoid: </b></i>Aminoglycosides (e.g., streptomycin, amikacin) are contraindicated for all
        pregnant women because of potential adverse effects on the fetus. Fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) have been associated
        with arthropathies in young animals; therefore, they should be avoided if possible in pregnant women.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    <li>Breast Feeding
    <p>
        The small concentrations of first line TB drugs in breast milk do not have a toxic effect on nursing newborns
        and <b>breast feeding should not be discouraged. </b>Conversely, drugs in breast milk should not be considered
        to serve as effective treatment for disease or as treatment of LTBI in a nursing infant.</p>

    <p><b>NOTES: Table 20 Special Situations</b></p>

    <p>(1) As
        with all medications given during pregnancy, anti-TB drugs should be used with caution. The risk of TB to the
        fetus far outweighs the risk of medications. Pregnant patients with active TB should be treated. Data are
        limited on the safety of some anti-TB drugs during pregnancy. Table 20 presents a consensus of published data
        and recommendations. Although detailed teratogenic data is not available, PZA can probably be used safely for
        pregnant patients. Concentrations of anti-TB drugs in breast milk are low; treatment with these medications is
        not a contraindication to breastfeeding. (Conversely, medication present in breast milk is not sufficient to
        prevent or treat TB in the newborn.) Consult a medical expert when treating a pregnant patient who has TB. For
        treatment of LTBI, most authorities recommend beginning INH several months after delivery, unless the woman is
        at high risk for progression to active TB (e.g., recent TST or IGRA conversion, HIV-infected).</p>
    <p>(2) Steroid treatment appears to improve outcome in TB meningitis, particularly in patients with altered mental
        status.</p>
    <p>(3) If possible, monitor serum drug levels of patients with renal insufficiency. See page 71 for dosage.</p>
    <p>(4) Supplement with pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) during pregnancy.</p>
    <p>(5) Has been used intrathecally; efficacy not documented.</p>
    <p>(6) Avoid aminoglycosides and capreomycin in patients with reversible renal damage, if possible.</p>
    <p>(7) Fluoroquinolones may accumulate in renal failure and are poorly removed by dialysis. Dose adjustment indicated.
