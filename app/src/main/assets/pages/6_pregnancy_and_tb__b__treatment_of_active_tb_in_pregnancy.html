        <i><b>TB disease discovered during pregnancy should be treated without delay. </b></i>Because of the risk
        for tuberculosis to the fetus, treatment of TB in pregnant women should be initiated whenever the
        probability of maternal disease is moderate to high. Three sputum samples should be submitted for
        examination. The outcome of the cultures and susceptibility test results will determine the regimen for
        continuation of treatment.</p>

            Pregnancy
            <ul>
                <li>The
                    initial treatment regimen usually consists of INH, RIF and EMB; consideration should be given to
                    including PZA.
                </li>
                <li>Although detailed teratogenicity data are not available, PZA can probably be used safely during
                    pregnancy and is
                    recommended for use by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union Against
                    Tuberculosis and
                    Lung Disease (IUATLD). In some U.S. jurisdictions, PZA has not been routinely recommended. PZA
                    should be
                    included in the initial regimen for HIV seropostive wom- en and for HIV seronegative women who are
                    thought to be
                    at high risk for drug resistant TB. If PZA is not includ- ed in the initial treatment regimen, the
                    minimum dura-
                    tion of therapy is 9 months.
                </li>
                <li>Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) (25 mg/d) is recommended for all pregnant women taking INH.</li>
                <li><i><b>Avoid: </b></i>Aminoglycosides (e.g., streptomycin, amikacin) are contraindicated for all
                    pregnant women because of potential adverse effects on the fetus. Fluoroquinolones (e.g.,
                    levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) have been associated
                    with arthropathies in young animals; therefore, they should be avoided if possible in pregnant
                    women.

        <li>Breast Feeding
            <p>
                The small concentrations of first line TB drugs in breast milk do not have a toxic effect on nursing
                newborns
                and <b>breast feeding should not be discouraged. </b>Conversely, drugs in breast milk should not be
                considered
                to serve as effective treatment for disease or as treatment of LTBI in a nursing infant.</p>

        <p><b>NOTES: Table 20 Special Situations</b></p>

        <p>(1) As
            with all medications given during pregnancy, anti-TB drugs should be used with caution. The risk of TB to
            the
            fetus far outweighs the risk of medications. Pregnant patients with active TB should be treated. Data are
            limited on the safety of some anti-TB drugs during pregnancy. Table 20 presents a consensus of published
            data
            and recommendations. Although detailed teratogenic data is not available, PZA can probably be used safely
            for
            pregnant patients. Concentrations of anti-TB drugs in breast milk are low; treatment with these medications
            is
            not a contraindication to breastfeeding. (Conversely, medication present in breast milk is not sufficient to
            prevent or treat TB in the newborn.) Consult a medical expert when treating a pregnant patient who has TB.
            For
            treatment of LTBI, most authorities recommend beginning INH several months after delivery, unless the woman
            is
            at high risk for progression to active TB (e.g., recent TST or IGRA conversion, HIV-infected).</p>
        <p>(2) Steroid treatment appears to improve outcome in TB meningitis, particularly in patients with altered
            mental
            status.</p>
        <p>(3) If possible, monitor serum drug levels of patients with renal insufficiency. See page 71 for dosage.</p>
        <p>(4) Supplement with pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) during pregnancy.</p>
        <p>(5) Has been used intrathecally; efficacy not documented.</p>
        <p>(6) Avoid aminoglycosides and capreomycin in patients with reversible renal damage, if possible.</p>
        <p>(7) Fluoroquinolones may accumulate in renal failure and are poorly removed by dialysis. Dose adjustment
            indicated.
