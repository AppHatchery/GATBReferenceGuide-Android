    <p> The tuberculin skin test (TST) measures a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction (recruitment of
        memory T cells to the site of an intradermal injection of purified protein derivative
        [PPD]). The TST should be carried out using the Mantoux method. Multiple puncture tests (Tine and Heaf)
        should <b>not</b> be used.
        Tuberculin skin tests should be administered and read by trained
        healthcare personnel. The TST is administered by injecting 0.1 ml
        of 5 tuberculin units (TU) PPD into the dorsal or volar surface of
        the forearm. The injection is made with a disposable tuberculin
        syringe, with the needle bevel facing upward and placed just under the surface of the skin, so that a
        discrete, pale elevation of
        the skin (a wheal) 6 mm to 10 mm in diameter is produced.</p>

    <p> Needles should not be recapped, purposely bent or broken, removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise
        manipulated by
        hand. Dispose of needles and syringes in puncture-resistant containers. Follow standard precautions for
        infection control.</p>
    <p>
        TSTs should be read 48 to 72 hours after administration. If test
        reading is delayed, a positive reaction may still be measurable up
        to one week after testing. A test cannot be read as negative if
        more than 72 hours have passed since it was placed. The transverse diameter of palpable <b>induration</b>
        should be
        measured and
        <b>recorded in millimeters</b>. If no induration is present, record “0
        mm.” Do not measure erythema (redness).</p>

    <p> Limitations of the TST include cross reactions between TST and
        Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Tuberculin skin testing is not
        contraindicated for persons
        who have been vaccinated with BCG, but an advantage of the
        IGRAs is that they do not cross react with BCG (see below). A
        positive TST in a BCG-vaccinated person is assumed to indicate
        infection with M. <i>tuberculosis</i> when the person tested is at increased risk for recent infection, is
        from an
        area with high rates
        of TB, or has a medical condition that increases the risk for disease (<a href="2_diagnostic_tests_for_latent_tb_infection_(ltbi)__b__criteria_for_a_positive_tuberculin_test_by_risk_group.html">Section II, B</a>)</p>
