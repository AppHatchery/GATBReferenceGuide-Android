        Administrative controls are most important and include measures to reduce the risk of exposure to persons with
        infectious TB; this includes careful screening, early identification and treatment of patients with TB. A high
        index of suspicion is critical. Patients with or at risk for TB need to be isolated upon admission (placed in a
        negative pressure airborne infection isolation [AII] room). Unsuspected patients with active TB disease and
        misdiagnosis (especially among HIV-infected patients who may have “atypical” or non-classical presentations)
        have led to nosocomial transmission at a number of hospitals (as well as at correctional institutions and other
        health care facilities).</p>

        Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta has prevented nosocomial transmission in large part by the effective use of
        administrative controls. Careful screening of patients and isolation of those at risk for TB have been
        accomplished by the introduction of an expanded respiratory isolation policy.</p>
