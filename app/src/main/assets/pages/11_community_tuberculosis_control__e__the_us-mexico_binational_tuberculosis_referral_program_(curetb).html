    <p>CureTB (<a
            href="https://www.curetb.org">www.curetb.org</a>) is a referral and continuity of care program for
        tuberculosis patients and their contacts who travel between the United States and Mexico. Services are
        available for patients, their families and providers from any state in the United States or Mexico. CureTB also
        provides services for patients travelling to other countries.</p>
    <p>CureTB
        facilitates and supports continuity of care for individuals with active tuberculosis disease and their contacts
        and provides linkages to ongoing care and follow-up for all referred patients. CureTB accepts referrals from
        health departments, correctional facilities, and other entities that diagnose or treat patients with
        tuberculosis.</p>
    <p>The Binational Card is a tool to
        help mobile patients and their families
        connect with CureTB when they arrive at their next destination. They can also give the card to their provider
        to connect with CureTB to obtain the latest clinical information. The card is easy to carry and has the CureTB
        1-800 number, reachable from inside or outside the U.S.</p>
