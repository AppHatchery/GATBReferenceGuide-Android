        <i>* Hypersensitivity reaction to rifamycins (rifampin or rifapentine): reactions may
            include a flu-like syndrome (e.g. fever, chills, headaches, dizziness, musculoskeletal pain),
            thrombocytopenia, shortness of breath or other signs and symptoms including wheezing, acute bronchospasm,
            urticaria, petechiae, purpura,
            pruritus, conjunctivitis, angioedema, hypotension or shock. If moderate to
            severe reaction (e.g. thrombocytopenia, hypotension), hospitalization or lifethreatening event: Discontinue
            treatment. If mild reaction (e.g. rash, dizziness,
            fever): Continue to monitor patient closely with a low threshold for discontinuing treatment. A flu-like
            syndrome appears to be the most common side effect
            profile leading to discontinuation of the 3HP regimen.</i>
