    <p>Treatment of persons living with HIV with active TB disease should be carried out in consultation with a
        physician
        who has experience in the use of rifamycin drugs and antiretroviral agents. Recommendations on the treatment of
        TB
        in combination with antiretroviral therapy continue to evolve, and it is important to check for updated
        guidelines:
        <a href="https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines">https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines</a></p>

    <p>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves outcomes for persons living with HIV and decreases HIV-related mortality.
        Patients in the United States with tuberculosis disease who are HIV co-infected commonly have advanced HIV/AIDS
        with
        low CD4 counts and high plasma HIV RNA levels; all TB patients with HIV co-infection should receive treatment
        for
        HIV with ART.</p>

    <h3>Timing of ART</h3>

    <p>Multiple studies have demonstrated the benefits of ART initiation among people living with HIV during TB
        treatment,
        including a reduction in mortality. However, the use of ART among persons living with HIV with active TB disease
        is
        complicated by overlapping toxicity profiles of some antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs; complex
        drug-drug
        interactions; and the occurrence of ‘paradoxical” or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). There
        are
        certain situations where ART therapy should be delayed. A study of people living with HIV with TB meningitis
        found
        that early ART was associated with an increase in severe adverse events and no mortality benefit. Thus, timing
        of
        ART initiation in HIV-TB patients should take into account both the degree of immune suppression and site of
        disease
        (see Table 16). Patients who are already on ART at the time of TB diagnosis, generally should be continued on
        the
        ART treatment (though ART regimen may need to be adjusted).</p>

    <h3>Choice of ART</h3>

    <p>Because of the potential for significant drug interactions and overlapping toxicities, the choice of ART among
        persons living with HIV who have active TB disease should be made only after direct communication between HIV
        and
        tuberculosis care providers. Any change in either the TB medications or the ART regimen should be immediately
        shared
        between the 2 providers.</p>

    <p>There are clinically important drug-drug interactions between the rifamycins (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) and some
        of
        the antiretroviral drugs, especially integrase and protease inhibitors. The rifamycins are inducers of the
        cytochrome P450-3A (CYP3A) system in the liver and thereby decrease serum concentrations of drugs metabolized by
        this system including integrase and protease inhibitors. Rifampin is a potent inducer of the CYP3A, while
        rifabutin
        is a less potent inducer. Rifampin cannot be given with most protease inhibitors because it results in low serum
        levels of these drugs. Rifabutin has less of an effect and therefore can be used with certain protease
        inhibitors as
        described below. Rifampin and rifabutin can be given with certain integrase inhibitors.</p>

    <p>The protease inhibitors also affect rifamycin metabolism and because the rifamycin metabolism is retarded by
        these
        drugs, the dose of rifabutin needs to be reduced in order to avoid rifabutin related toxicity.</p>

    <p>Despite these drug-drug interactions, a rifamycin (rifampin or rifabutin) should ALWAYS be included in the
        treatment
        regiment for drug susceptible TB among persons living with HIV.</p>

    <p>Rifampin can be given with the following antiretrovirals:
    <ul>
        <li>MOST Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (e.g.,zidovudine, lamivudine,
            emtricitabine,
            tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), abacavir). Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is not currently recommended for
            use
            in combination with rifamycins.
        </li>
        <li>SELECTED Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): efavirenz only (all others are
            contraindicated for coadministration with rifampin).
        </li>
        <li>Selected Integrase inhibitors: raltegravir and dolutegravir. The dose of raltegravir must be increased to
            800 mg
            bis in die (twice daily) (BID) and dose of dolutegravir must be increased to 50 mg BID for patients on
            rifampin.
            Neither drug requires a dosing change when used with rifabutin.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Rifampin should NOT be used with the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Tenofoviral afenamide(TAF)</li>
        <li>Protease inhibitors</li>
        <li>Nevirapine, etravirine, rilpivarine (NNRTIs)</li>
        <li>Bictegravir, elvitegravir</li>
    </ul>

                Efavirenz is not a preferred regimen for patients initiating ART. Integrase inhibitors DTG and RAL are
                preferred ART regimens for patients initiating ART but require BID dosing if used with rifampin.
                Efavirenz
                has low barrier to resistance making this regimen less suitable when there is high risk for poor
                adherence.
                Efavirenz is associated with neuropsychiatric side-effects. Screening for depression and suicidality is
                recommended prior to and during efavirenz-based regimens. Efavirenz + ABC/3TC is associated with higher
                rates of virologic failure when baseline HIV viral load is >100.000 copies/ml.

                with
                PI’s adherence to ART should be closely monitored. Poor adherence to PI’s while on rifabutin increases
