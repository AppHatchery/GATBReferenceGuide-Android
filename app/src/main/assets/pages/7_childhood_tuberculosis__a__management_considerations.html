        <li>TB disease in infants and children younger than 4 years of age is much more likely to disseminate;
            therefore,
            prompt evaluation and treatment should be started when the diagnosis is suspected.
        </li>
        <li>Mycobacterial culture of respiratory specimens for children with suspected pulmonary TB is recommended.
            Acceptable specimens include induced sputa or early morning gastric aspirates on
            3 consecutive days for children who cannot produce sputa. In cases when the adult source case is known, it
            is
            acceptable to rely on the results of susceptibility tests of specimens from the adult source case to guide
            the
            treatment regimen. However, when the <i>M. tuberculosis </i>isolate from the presumed source patient is not
            available or in cases of suspected drug-resistant TB, obtaining induced sputa or early morning gastric
            aspirates
            from the young child should be performed. In certain situations, bronchoalveolar lavage or tissue biopsy may
            be considered.
        </li>
        <li>Primary
            intrathoracic TB (parenchymal infiltration, hilar adenopathy, or both, in a child with evidence of
            tuberculosis
            exposure) should be treated in the same manner as pulmonary TB.
        </li>
        <li>An empiric regimen of four drugs (INH, RIF, PZA, EMB) for 2 months and RIF and INH for the remaining 4
            months when
            the possibility of drug resistance is low is recommended. A three-drug regimen (INH, RIF, PZA) can be used
            as
            initial therapy when the isolate (i.e., from source TB case) is known to be fully drug susceptible. Children
            and
            adolescents with “adult-type” tuberculosis consisting of cavitation and AFB positive sputum samples should
            receive a 4-drug regimen initially until susceptibility is proven. The persistence of cavitary lesions
            and/or a
            positive sputum culture after 2 months of therapy may warrant extension to a 9-month course of therapy.
        </li>
        <li>When
            clinical or epidemiologic circumstances suggest an increased probability of INH resistance, EMB can be used
            safely at a
            dose of 15—20 mg/kg per day as a fourth drug, even in children too young for routine eye testing.
            Streptomycin,
            kanamycin or amikacin can also be used as a fourth drug when necessary. Either an aminoglycoside or
            ethionamide should be used as the fourth drug in cases of TB meningitis.
        </li>
        <li>In general, extrapulmonary TB, including cervical adenopathy (scrofula), can be treated with the same
            regimen as
            pulmonary TB (i.e., 6 months for drug-susceptible disease). Exceptions include TB meningitis for which 12
            months of therapy is currently recommended.
        </li>
        <li>Directly observed therapy is the standard of care for all children. HIV testing should be performed on all
            individuals with TB disease (including children) as the treatment regimen (including need for antiretroviral
            therapy) is altered with HIV infection.
        </li>
        <li>Clinical and radiographic examinations may be monitored for response to therapy. However, resolution of
            abnormal
            findings on chest radiography with pulmonary or intrathoracic lymphadenopathy may lag behind clinical
            response. Chest radiography is usually not performed at the conclusion of a successful course of treatment
            and
            should not be used as a criterion for discontinuing anti-TB drugs.
        </li>
        <li>Management of the newborn infant whose mother or other caregiver is suspected of having TB is based on
            individual considerations. Separation of the mother (or caregiver) and infant should be minimized, if
            possible. Differing circumstances and resulting
            recommendations are as follows:
            <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
                <li><i><b>Mother
                    or other caregiver who has a positive tuberculin skin test or IGRA and normal chest radiography.</b></i>
                    If,
                    after investigation, no evidence of active TB disease is found in the mother or caregiver to whom
                    the infant is
                    exposed, separation of mother or caregiver and infant is not indicated. These mothers may breastfeed
                    their
                    infants. Evaluation of all contacts should be performed to attempt to identify a source case.
                </li>
                <li><i><b>Mother or other caregiver who has abnormal chest radiography suggestive of tuberculosis
                    disease but is judged to be noninfectious at delivery. </b></i>The situation in which a mother or
                    caregiver’s
                    history, physical examination, and sputa examination do not suggest active disease may be considered
                    to be a low
                    risk exposure and the separation of mother/ caregiver and the infant is not necessary. The
                    mother/caregiver
                    should receive therapy and contacts should be evaluated with a TST or IGRA to attempt to identify a
                    source
                    case. The infant should be followed closely by a pediatric provider.
                </li>
                <li><i><b>Mother who has active TB disease and is suspected of being infectious at the time of
                    delivery.</b></i>The infant should be assessed for evidence of congenital tuberculosis and the
                    mother/caregiver should be evaluated for HIV infection. A healthcare provider with expertise in the
                    treatment of infants with
                    congenital tuberculosis should be consulted to assist with management of the infant’s anti-TB
                    regimen. If congenital tuberculosis is not suspected, the infant
                    should receive INH (10 mg/kg/ dose) daily until the infant is 3 – 4 months of age when a TST should
                    be placed.
                    If the TST result is reactive, an evaluation for tuberculosis disease should be conducted. If TB
                    disease is
                    excluded, the infant should continue to receive INH until 9 months of age with monthly assessments
                    to complete
                    treatment for LTBI. If the TST at 3–4 months of age is nonreactive and the mother/ caregiver’s
                    adherence to
                    therapy can be documented and is no longer infectious, the infant’s INH may be discontinued.
                </li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>For a
        mother/caregiver who has active TB disease and is infectious, the mother/caregiver and infant should be
        separated until the mother/caregiver and infant have received appropriate anti-tuberculosis therapy. The
        mother/caregiver should wear a mask and follow appropriate infection control procedures until she/ he has been
        judged to be noninfectious. The mother/caregiver should be separated from the infant in situations where
        infection with MDR TB is possible and/or adherence to therapy cannot be documented. BCG immunization may be
        considered for the infant in these situations. Women with tuberculosis disease who have received 2 weeks of
        appropriate therapy and who are not considered to be infectious may breastfeed. A healthcare provider with
        expertise in tuberculosis should be consulted to assist with recommendations in individual situations when a
        woman receiving antituberculosis therapy wishes to provide human milk to an infant.</p>
