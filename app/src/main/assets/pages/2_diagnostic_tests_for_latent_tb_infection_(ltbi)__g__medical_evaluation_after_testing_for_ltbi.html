        <li><b>Neither an IGRA nor a TST can distinguish LTBI from active
            TB disease</b>. A negative IGRA or TST does not rule out active TB
            disease.
        </li>
        <li>Persons with a positive IGRA or TST should be evaluated for
            the likelihood of M. tuberculosis infection, for risks for progression to active TB if infected, and for
            symptoms and signs of
            active TB.
        </li>
        <li><b>A diagnosis of LTBI requires that active TB be excluded by
            medical evaluation</b> which should include taking a medical
            history and a physical exam to check for suggestive symptoms
            and signs, a chest x-ray (CXR), and when indicated, testing of
            sputum or other clinical samples for the presence of M. tuberculosis.
        </li>
        <li>Persons with a newly documented diagnostic test for LTBI
            (positive IGRA or TST) should have a chest x-ray performed to
            ensure that they do not have active TB disease. After an initial
            negative chest x-ray, <span class="uk-text-bold" style="text-decoration: underline">no routine follow-up chest x-rays are
            necessary</span>. Persons with a positive diagnostic test for LTBI
            should be educated about the signs and symptoms of active TB
            disease and instructed to consult with a physician if these
            symptoms occur.
        </li>

        <li>In healthy persons who have a low likelihood both of M. tuberculosis infection and of progression to active
            TB disease if infected, a single positive IGRA or TST result should not be taken
            as reliable evidence of M. tuberculosis infection. Because of the low probability of infection, a
            false-positive result is more likely. In such situations, the likelihood of M. tuberculosis infection
            and of disease progression should be reassessed, and the initial
            test results should be confirmed. Repeat testing, with either
            the initial test or a different test, may be considered on a caseby-case basis. For such persons, an
            alternative is to assume,
            without additional testing, that the initial result is a false positive. This becomes somewhat complex
            because of the lack of a
            “gold standard” diagnostic test for LTBI. For healthy persons
            who have a low risk for both infection and progression, discounting an isolated positive result as a false
            positive may be
            reasonable. This will increase detection specificity and decrease unnecessary treatment.
        </li>

        <li>
            In persons with <b>discordant test results</b> (i.e., one positive and
            the other negative), decisions about medical or public health
            management require individualized judgment in assessing the
            quality and magnitude of each test result (e.g., size of induration and presence of blistering for a TST;
            and the TB Response,
            Nil, and Mitogen values for an IGRA), the probability of infection, the risk for disease if infected, and
            the risk for a poor
            outcome if disease occurs. Patients who are at high risk for
            progression to active TB when LTBI is present (e.g., persons
            living with HIV, those scheduled to begin a TNF-α inhibitor,
            children < 5 years) should be assumed to have LTBI if one diagnostic test is positive (even if there are
            discordant results). For
            persons who have received BCG and who are not at increased
            risk for a poor outcome if infected, TST reactions of < 15 mm in
            size may reasonably be discounted as false positives when an
            IGRA is negative. In other situations, inadequate evidence exists on which to base recommendations for
            dealing with discordant results. Consultation with a TB expert should be considered when discordant results
            are present.
        </li>

        <li>Persons with a positive diagnostic test for LTBI who have active TB excluded, should be considered for
            treatment of LTBI.
            Treatment of LTBI is recommended for those at increased risk
            of progression to active TB disease (see
            <a href="2_diagnostic_tests_for_latent_tb_infection_(ltbi)__f__targeted_testing_and_diagnostic_tests_for_ltbi.htmlable_3_high_prevalence_and_high_risk_groups">Table
                3</a>). Treatment
            regimens for LTBI are described in the following pages.
